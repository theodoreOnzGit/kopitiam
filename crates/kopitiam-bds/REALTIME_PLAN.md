# REALTIME_SPEC_DRAFT Implementation Plan (Detailed, v0.5, self-contained)

This document describes the fundamental, architecture-level changes required to
implement REALTIME_SPEC_DRAFT. It is intentionally detailed and focuses on
data flow, invariants, module boundaries, and shared types rather than concrete
code edits. It preserves all prior plan details and augments them with decisions
made in review: shared types live in src/core, canonical CBOR uses minicbor with
custom canonical encoding for hashed payloads, WAL indexing uses SQLite behind
an abstraction, and replication remains threaded.

It is also intentionally self-contained. The spec remains the source of truth,
but this plan restates the high-risk and high-coupling requirements so an
engineer can implement independently without re-deriving semantics.

This plan assumes the current baseline:
- Canonical state lives in memory and syncs via Git ref `refs/heads/beads/store`.
- Current "WAL" is a per-remote snapshot file (`src/daemon/wal.rs`), not an event log.
- IPC is ndjson over Unix socket (`src/daemon/ipc.rs`).
- Mutations apply directly to `CanonicalState` (`src/daemon/executor.rs` +
  apply_wal_mutation in `src/daemon/core.rs`).
- CRDT semantics are LWW per-field plus tombstones/deps (`src/core/*`).

-----

## v0.5 scope changes (compared to v0.4)

v0.5 narrows scope to land the durable event log + deterministic apply + replication,
while removing several high-complexity features that are not required to achieve
the core guarantees.

### Added / changed in v0.5

- Hashing model simplified (major):
  - Events are hashed over the raw bytes of the EventBody CBOR payload.
  - sha256 and prev_sha256 live in the WAL record header and replication frame header,
    not inside the hashed CBOR payload.
  - There is no longer a "preimage vs envelope" dual-encoding requirement.

- Forward compatibility simplified:
  - Unknown-key byte preservation for hash verification is no longer required.
  - Nodes can store and forward raw EventBody bytes without re-encoding.

- Idempotency storage simplified:
  - Replace the 2-phase client_requests (PENDING/COMMITTED) state machine with a
    stable idempotency mapping table. Receipts are reconstructed on demand.

- Git checkpoints decoupled from durability:
  - Git checkpoints remain a deterministic checkpoint lane for bootstrap/recovery.
  - Git is not a requestable "wait target" durability class in v0.5.

- WAL remains per-namespace:
  - v0.5 explicitly keeps per-namespace WAL segments and SQLite indexing.
  - No per-origin WAL directory structure is introduced in v0.5.

### Deferred in v0.5 (explicit)

- Namespace GC marker events and retention enforcement (policy parsed, not enforced by events).
- WAL pruning and all correctness machinery required to safely delete WAL segments.
- Replication snapshots (SNAPSHOT_* messages) and peer-to-peer snapshot bootstrap.
  Bootstrap and catch-up rely on checkpoints (Git or local cache) in v0.5.

### Removed in v0.5 (explicit)

- Self-hashing CBOR envelopes (CBOR envelope containing its own sha256 / prev_sha256).
- Unknown-field byte-for-byte preservation for hash reconstruction (the v0.4 0.6.1 requirement).
- GitCheckpointed durability class as a client-requestable wait condition.

### Migration notes (v0.5)

- WAL/on-wire payloads are now EventBody bytes with sha/prev in headers; v0.4 prototype WAL
  data is not compatible without a migration tool.
- If multiple formats must coexist, bump wal_format_version and gate upgrades explicitly;
  do not auto-mix formats in a single store.

-----

## North star

Ops produce events; events go to WAL; WAL drives apply; apply drives checkpoint;
replication ships events and watermarks.

More concretely:
1) Client sends mutation request (namespace-scoped).
2) Daemon validates, builds a single deterministic event delta (Txn-style),
   appends one event to the event WAL, fsyncs per durability policy.
3) Daemon applies the event(s) to in-memory state using a pure deterministic
   apply path.
4) Daemon returns an explicit durability receipt (including min-seen watermarks).
5) Daemon asynchronously replicates events to peers/anchors and schedules Git
   checkpoints (groups).

---

## Current state vs target state

Current state:
- Canonical state lives in memory and syncs via Git ref `refs/heads/beads/store`.
- Local "WAL" is a per-remote snapshot file, not an event log.
- State identity is effectively derived from remote URL and repo path.

Target state (REALTIME_SPEC_DRAFT):
- Event WAL per namespace is the unit of durability and replication.
- Git becomes a deterministic checkpoint lane (hot or cold), not the log.
- Store identity is stable and independent of transport.

---

## 0) Locked decisions and guiding constraints (expanded, must not drift)

The following decisions are locked and should be treated as non-negotiable.
They are restated verbatim with options, rationale, and impacts to ensure no
detail is lost during implementation.

### 0.0 Prior locked constraints (from the original plan)

- Shared types live in `src/core/*` (no new `src/store/*` root).
  This keeps daemon, git, API, and CLI on a single domain model.
- Canonical CBOR uses `minicbor` with a custom canonical encoder for hashed payloads.
  `minicbor_serde` is allowed only for non-hashed messages.
- WAL index uses SQLite (via `rusqlite`) behind a WalIndex trait.
  WAL segments are authoritative; the index is rebuildable cache state.
- Replication uses thread-based sessions, consistent with current daemon architecture.

### 0.1 Store identity: stop keying by RemoteUrl, keep multi-clone ergonomics

Options:
1) Keep current `RemoteUrl(normalize_url(...))` as primary key and bolt
   `store_id` on later.
2) Move to `StoreId` as the sole canonical key, treat `RemoteUrl` purely
   as a legacy discovery hint.
3) Hybrid: daemon internal map keyed by `StoreId`, plus a separate "transport
   identity" map keyed by `RemoteUrl` that only exists for Git lane compatibility
   and migration.

Recommendation to lock now: choose the hybrid with a strong rule: "all correctness
and state are keyed by StoreId; RemoteUrl only selects a checkpoint lane and
assists discovery during migration."

Rationale:
- `Daemon { repos: BTreeMap<RemoteUrl, RepoState>, path_to_remote: HashMap<PathBuf, RemoteUrl> }`
  in `src/daemon/core.rs` is the current system spine.
- If identity is not corrected now, every later change (namespaces, WAL, replication,
  durability) becomes entangled with legacy identity.

Risks if deferred:
- Namespace/WAL/index are implemented twice: once "per remote", then again
  "per store".
- Migration becomes non-local because identity leaks into filenames
  (`src/daemon/wal.rs` hashes remote URL into WAL filename) and into operational
  semantics (WAL deletion after sync).

Modules impacted:
- `src/daemon/core.rs` (replace repos map key, rewrite resolve/load flow)
- `src/daemon/remote.rs` (relegated to legacy normalization + fallback)
- `src/paths.rs` (store directory path shape)
- `src/git/sync.rs` (checkpoint lane keyed by store_id/group, not remote-url)
- `src/daemon/wal.rs` (legacy WAL naming uses remote hash today)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- A single source-of-truth mapping from (repo path or git remote) to StoreId
  must exist and must not depend on the remote URL string being stable.

### 0.2 Store directory layout and process-level locking

Options:
1) No locking, assume one daemon process per user.
2) File lock per store dir (recommended if you ever run multiple daemons or crash
   mid-write).
3) Lock per subsystem (WAL lock separate from checkpoint lock).

Recommendation to lock now: take a single lock file in
`$BD_DATA_DIR/stores/<store_id>/` at daemon open (store-global lock).
Keep it simple.

Lock metadata + stale handling (normative):
- The lock file MUST contain (at least): store_id, replica_id, pid, started_at_ms, daemon_version.
- The lock file SHOULD also include: last_heartbeat_ms.
  The daemon SHOULD update last_heartbeat_ms periodically while holding the lock
  (recommended: every 10s). Failure to update MUST NOT affect correctness; heartbeat
  is advisory for staleness detection.
- On lock acquisition failure:
  - If the lock is held, fail fast with a clear error pointing to lock metadata.
  - If the lock appears stale (pid does not exist), provide a documented manual
    recovery procedure (do not auto-delete by default).

Recovery ergonomics (recommended):
- Provide a CLI helper `bd store unlock --store-id <id>` that:
  - reads lock metadata and displays it,
  - checks if pid exists on the local system,
  - if pid does NOT exist: removes the lock file (safe case),
  - if pid exists but is a different process (e.g., pid reuse): removes the lock file,
  - if pid exists and appears to be a daemon process: requires `--force` flag,
  - logs the unlock action for traceability.
- This reduces unsafe manual `rm` of lock files while still allowing recovery.

Rationale:
- Today, durability is "atomic rename + fsync" into a single snapshot WAL file.
- With segmented WAL + SQLite, you have multiple mutable files and background
  threads. A process-level lock prevents "two writers" bugs that are otherwise
  very hard to diagnose.

Risks if deferred:
- Locks get added after format assumptions in WAL replay and index rebuild,
  creating subtle deadlocks or partial write states.

Modules impacted:
- `src/paths.rs` (store dir computation; env overrides)
- new `src/daemon/store_runtime.rs` or similar (open store dir, acquire lock)
- new `src/daemon/wal/index.rs` (SQLite connection mode depends on locking choice)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- Code that opens SQLite and code that appends WAL must share the same locking story.
  "SQLite locking will save us" is not a plan because WAL segments are separate files.

### 0.3 Namespaces: where namespace lives in the data model

Options:
1) Make `CanonicalState` namespace-aware by changing keys to `(NamespaceId, BeadId)`
   and updating all internal indexes.
2) Keep `CanonicalState` exactly as-is and introduce
   `StoreState = BTreeMap<NamespaceId, CanonicalState>`.
3) Hybrid: `StoreState` map plus selective global indexes for cross-namespace queries.

Recommendation to lock now: keep `CanonicalState` unchanged and add `StoreState`
as the namespace boundary. Enforce "no cross-namespace deps" by construction:
dep operations always operate within a `CanonicalState` selected by namespace.

Rationale:
- `src/core/state.rs` contains derived dep indexes keyed by `BeadId`. If you
  namespace the keys inside `CanonicalState`, you touch almost every line in core.
- With `StoreState`, you localize namespace handling to call sites and keep CRDT
  algebra unchanged.

Risks if deferred:
- Every query and operation assumes single namespace and you retrofit later,
  causing inconsistent behavior (some paths default to core, others accidentally
  operate across all).
- Dep invariants (DAG enforcement for Blocks/Parent) get tricky if IDs collide
  across namespaces.

Modules impacted:
- `src/core/state.rs` (add `StoreState` type and accessors, leave CanonicalState
  mostly intact)
- `src/daemon/query.rs` (queries become namespace-scoped, and "status" might be
  per-namespace or aggregated)
- `src/daemon/ipc.rs` (add `namespace: Option<String>` to requests, default "core")
- `src/daemon/executor.rs` (every apply_* chooses namespace first)
- `src/api/mod.rs` (surface namespace in outputs)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- There must be a single defaulting rule ("if absent, namespace = core") used by IPC,
  CLI, and internal calls so the system cannot diverge.

### 0.4 Namespace policy representation

Options:
1) Config-only (`config.toml`), keep repo as dumb store.
2) Store-local `namespaces.toml` under `$BD_DATA_DIR/stores/<store_id>/`.
3) Git-published policies (checkpoint meta) as authoritative.

Recommendation to lock now: policies are store-local files (`namespaces.toml`)
and are optionally published via checkpoint metadata later. Keep initial
implementation minimal: load policies at store open; changes require restart
or explicit reload op.

Reload semantics (normative):
- Add an admin-only reload operation that re-reads namespaces.toml and validates it.
- Live-reload MAY apply changes that do not alter on-disk format or cross-component invariants:
  - visibility, ready_eligible, retention windows, ttl_basis (if GC marker semantics unchanged)
  - per-namespace limits (max record bytes, max ops) if only tightening constraints
- Changes that MUST require restart (or explicit "drain+restart" workflow):
  - checkpoint group membership, durable_copy_via_git toggles, replication listen params,
    replicate_mode changes that would require reconnecting sessions or rewriting durable sets.

Rationale:
- If policies are Git-authoritative too early, you couple checkpoint import to
  configuration semantics, complicating bootstrapping and migration.

Modules impacted:
- `src/config.rs` (likely expands, but do not overload it with store identity)
- new `src/core/namespace.rs` (NamespaceId + policy structs)
- new daemon store open path (load policies)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- Policy parsing must be deterministic and validated early so replication and
  checkpoint code can rely on it without defensive checks everywhere.

### 0.5 Event identity and origin sequence allocation

Options:
1) In-memory counter per namespace, persisted periodically (risk: duplicates).
2) Allocate origin_seq by reading "max seq for local replica" from SQLite inside
   WAL append transaction and incrementing (strong).
3) Allocate by scanning WAL tail at startup and caching (works but still needs
   concurrency control to avoid duplicates under parallel appends).

Recommendation to lock now: origin sequence allocation happens inside
`EventWal::append` using the SQLite index as the authoritative counter for
`(namespace, local_replica_id)`, inside a transaction that also records appended
event offsets. On startup, if the index is missing, rebuild it by scanning WAL
segments, then sequence allocation works again.

Rationale:
- The plan treats SQLite as a rebuildable cache, but for sequence allocation,
  you need an authoritative monotonic source to avoid equivocation.
- WAL is authoritative, but scanning WAL to allocate the next seq per append is
  too expensive.

Risks if deferred:
- Apply/replication logic assumes uniqueness, then duplicates appear after crash
  windows. Duplicates are protocol-level corruption because event_id must be unique.

Modules impacted:
- new `src/daemon/wal/mod.rs` (append API returns assigned seqs)
- new `src/daemon/wal/index.rs` (must support "next seq" or equivalent)
- new `src/core/identity.rs` (ReplicaId, EventId)
- replication receive path (must reject existing event_id with different sha)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- append must be single-writer per namespace within a process (mutex or channel
  serialization), and "next seq" allocation must be tied to the same durability
  boundary as writing the record.

### 0.6 Canonical CBOR encoding and hashing (v0.5 simplified)

Options:
1) Use `minicbor_serde` everywhere and hope it matches canonical requirements
   (it will not for hashing).
2) Manual `minicbor::Encode` with explicit ordering and definite lengths for
   hashed types only (plan).
3) Use numeric keys to reduce size and canonicalize easily, deviating from spec's
   human-readable field names.

Recommendation to lock now (v0.5): keep spec-aligned string keys for event body
maps and implement a canonical encoder for the hashed payload `EventBody`.

v0.5 removes the self-hashing envelope requirement. Instead:
- The on-disk and on-wire payload is `event_body_bytes`: canonical CBOR encoding of EventBody.
- `sha256 = SHA256(event_body_bytes)`.
- `prev_sha256` is carried in the WAL record header and replication frame header
  as a chain link for contiguity checks.

Hashing rule (normative, v0.5):
- sha256 MUST be computed over `event_body_bytes` exactly as stored/transmitted.
- WAL storage and replication payloads MUST carry `event_body_bytes` unchanged.
- Receivers MUST verify `sha256(event_body_bytes) == header.sha256` before persisting.

Canonical acceptance (v0.5):
- Locally-authored events MUST be encoded using the canonical encoder for EventBody
  (definite-length, sorted keys, no floats).
- Receivers MUST enforce decoding limits and MUST reject:
  - payloads that exceed size/depth/map-entry bounds,
  - indefinite-length encodings for hashed structures,
  - floats in EventBody.
- Receivers MAY enforce full RFC 8949 canonical CBOR for `event_body_bytes` by
  implementation choice, but v0.5 does not require byte-compare re-encoding for
  acceptance, because hashes are verified over raw bytes and raw bytes are persisted.

Rationale:
- The minute you ship events between replicas, the hash is a correctness primitive.
  If encoding differs across platforms or versions, you have a fork in reality.

Risks if deferred:
- You will write a WAL format and replication protocol, then discover the
  encoding is not stable. Retrofitting canonical encoding after data exists
  means WAL migration tools.

Modules impacted:
- new `src/core/event.rs` (EventBody + encode_canonical + hash computation)
- new `src/daemon/wal/frame.rs` (stores bytes, computes crc on bytes)
- replication protocol modules (EVENTS frames contain canonical bytes)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- The system must maintain a single definition of `event_body_bytes` and a stable
  canonical encoder for locally-authored events so that the local replica does not
  accidentally change its own event encoding across versions.

### 0.6.1 (Deferred in v0.5) Unknown-key byte preservation for self-hashing envelopes

v0.4 required lossless unknown-key byte preservation to support re-encoding a
self-hashing envelope for verification.

v0.5 hashes over raw `event_body_bytes` and persists/forwards those bytes unchanged.
This removes the need to reconstruct a canonical preimage byte-for-byte.

Deferred to a future version only if the design re-introduces a self-hashing CBOR
envelope with embedded hash fields.

### 0.7 Delta schema choice

Options:
1) Reuse `src/git/wire.rs` WireBead for checkpoints and `bead_upsert` deltas.
2) Create `src/core/wire_bead.rs` with WireBeadFull and WireBeadPatch, and treat
   git wire as legacy-only.
3) Hybrid: keep field names identical to git wire for compatibility, but define
   new types in core and only share conversion helpers.

Recommendation to lock now: hybrid. Define new core wire types for checkpoint and
delta (realtime lane not coupled to Git lane), but keep field names and stamp
representation identical to existing WireBead so conversion logic can be shared.

Rationale:
- `src/git/wire.rs` is currently an implementation detail of the legacy ref
  `refs/heads/beads/store`. Reusing it directly for realtime events couples
  legacy layout to realtime protocol.

Risks if deferred:
- You will "just call wire::serialize_state" for events, then later need patch
  semantics and notes omission rules, forcing invasive refactors.

Modules impacted:
- new `src/core/wire_bead.rs` (or similar)
- `src/git/wire.rs` (likely stays, but becomes legacy + maybe shared helpers)
- new `src/core/apply.rs` (apply patch semantics)
- `src/core/bead.rs` (notes handling decisions)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- Lock the notes rule now: `bead_upsert` deltas SHOULD omit notes, and if present
  are interpreted as set-union only (never truncation). This affects apply and storage.
- Lock dep delete semantics now: `dep_delete` is an idempotent LWW tombstone (no
  dep_not_found in apply/replay). DAG enforcement (Blocks/Parent cycles) is a
  mutation-planning check only; cross-namespace deps are rejected in planning.

### 0.8 Deterministic apply semantics

Options:
1) Apply events directly inside daemon state mutators.
2) Create `core::apply_event(&mut CanonicalState, &EventBody) -> ApplyOutcome`
   as pure logic, keep all I/O and indexing outside.
3) Apply returns index updates or notifications to keep side effects out.

Recommendation to lock now: make `core::apply_event` pure over a namespace state
and keep side effects in daemon. Keep the outcome minimal but useful: changed
bead ids, changed deps, new notes, advanced watermark, or no-op.

Rationale:
- CRDT joins already exist (`Lww::join`, `Tombstone::join`, `DepEdge::join`).
  The apply layer should be the only place that decides how deltas map to
  these primitives. This is mandatory for convergence.

Risks if deferred:
- Local ops and remote events diverge in corner cases (tombstone vs update
  resurrection, dep delete vs restore stamps, note id collision), and you will
  not detect it until replication.

Modules impacted:
- new `src/core/apply.rs`
- `src/daemon/executor.rs` (rewrite to generate deltas instead of mutating state)
- replication receive path (calls apply_event)
- checkpoint import (calls apply or merges states deterministically)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- Decide what "idempotent no-op" means. Spec: events with origin_seq <= seen_map
  must be no-op. Note id collision with different content resolves deterministically
  (D4) and should be logged/metric'd as corruption, not treated as LWW.

### 0.9 WAL segment naming and lifecycle

Options:
1) Name segments by timestamp only (`segment-<ts>.wal`), derive ranges by scanning.
2) Name by `(created_at_ms, first_origin_seq)` or include both.
3) One directory per namespace (spec) vs a flat directory with namespace in filename.

Recommendation to lock now: keep spec directory layout `wal/<namespace>/` and
name segments with a sortable prefix plus segment id (available at creation time):
`segment-<created_at_ms>-<segment_id>.wal`

`first_seq` remains a useful operator hint, but it MUST live in durable metadata
(segment header + SQLite `segments` table), not in the filename.

Rationale:
- Rebuild path needs deterministic ordering, and operators will look at filenames
  to sanity-check state.
- Embedding `first_seq` in the filename forces a rename after the first record is
  appended (because `first_seq` is unknown at file creation). Renames add directory
  fsyncs and create crash states (half-renamed segments or index rows pointing at
  a path that never became durable).
- `segment_id` is stable, globally unique, and becomes a natural join key across
  logs, SQLite rows, and filenames.

Risks if deferred:
- Index rebuild logic implicitly assumes ordering, then you rename format later
  and break compatibility or require migration.

Modules impacted:
- new `src/daemon/wal/segment.rs`
- new `src/daemon/wal/replay.rs` (scan order assumptions)
- new `src/daemon/wal/index.rs` (segment_path stored; naming affects stability)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- Define whether segment paths are part of the index primary key or just stored values.
  If you ever move/rename segments, index rebuild must be able to recover.

### 0.10 WAL framing and durability boundary (LocalFsync)

Options:
1) LocalFsync means fsync the record write only (fsync file, not directory).
2) LocalFsync means fsync file + directory entry durability where needed.
3) LocalFsync means fsync only at segment rotation boundaries.

Recommendation to lock now: LocalFsync means: append record, flush, fsync the
active segment file. On Unix, also fsync the directory when creating a new
segment file (on rotation), not on every record. This mirrors current snapshot
WAL logic (fsync file then directory after rename).

Performance note (recommended, correctness-preserving):
- The daemon MAY implement bounded group commit for LocalFsync and stronger classes:
  - multiple events can be appended under a single SQLite transaction and one fsync,
    as long as receipts are not returned until after the fsync and transaction commit.
  - bounds MUST be enforced (max latency/events/bytes) to keep tail latency predictable.

Rationale:
- Record-level fsync is the durability promise. Segment creation is metadata.
  Separate them to keep performance reasonable without weakening semantics.

Risks if deferred:
- Receipts and client behavior rely on durability that later turns out weaker
  than implied, which is a contract break.

Modules impacted:
- new `src/daemon/wal/segment.rs` (append + fsync)
- new `src/core/durability.rs` (semantic mapping)
- `src/daemon/ipc.rs` response timing (when to return receipt)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- WAL append must be atomic enough that replay either sees the record or does not.
  Tail-truncation rules must be implemented before trusting fsync boundaries.

### 0.11 SQLite index schema (replication + idempotency + receipts) (v0.5 simplified)

Options:
1) Events table only, no watermarks table.
2) Events + watermarks (plan suggests).
3) Add idempotency mapping table keyed by txn_id and/or client_request_id.

Recommendation to lock now (v0.5): implement events + watermarks + a stable
idempotency mapping table keyed by `(namespace, origin_replica_id, client_request_id)`
that stores:

- request_sha256 (canonicalized mutation request digest)
- txn_id
- event_ids (typically 1 event in v0.5)
- created_at_ms (optional convenience)

Receipts are reconstructed on demand from:
- the stored mapping (txn_id + event_ids),
- current applied watermarks for `min_seen`,
- current durability proof (local fsync and any observed replication ACKs).

This removes the PENDING/COMMITTED state machine and its crash-reconciliation logic.

Idempotency safety refinement (normative, v0.5):
- client_requests MUST store a request digest `request_sha256` computed from the parsed
  mutation request in a canonical form (excluding retry-only fields like wait_timeout_ms
  and excluding durability wait targets).
- If a request arrives with an existing (namespace, origin_replica_id, client_request_id)
  but a different request_sha256, the daemon MUST reject it with
  ERROR(code="client_request_id_reuse_mismatch") and MUST NOT return the prior receipt.
- WAL record headers MUST persist request_sha256 and client_request_id for locally
  authored events so the idempotency mapping can be rebuilt from WAL if SQLite is
  dropped/corrupted.

Receipt semantics (v0.5):
- min_seen is the server's applied watermarks at the time of the response being produced.
  On idempotent retry, min_seen may be >= the original response.
- On idempotent retry, the daemon MUST return the same txn_id + event_ids.
  The daemon MAY return a stronger (monotonic) durability_proof if additional durability
  has been achieved since the original response.
- If replication ACK state is not persisted, retries after restart may return a weaker
  durability_proof (e.g., LocalFsync only); this is acceptable and monotonic for new acks.

Rationale:
- Idempotency "return the same txn_id/event_ids" is preserved with a stable mapping,
  while receipts can be reconstructed from current watermarks and observed durability.

Risks if deferred:
- You implement idempotency by scanning or uniqueness constraints, then later need
  receipts anyway for API. Retrofitting is costly and error-prone.

Modules impacted:
- new `src/daemon/wal/index.rs` (schema + queries)
- new `src/core/durability.rs` (receipt shape)
- mutation pipeline module (idempotency check uses index)
- `src/api/mod.rs` (DurabilityReceipt exposure)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- Decide on binary vs text storage for UUIDs in SQLite (BLOB 16 bytes is best).
  Lock this now because schema migration is annoying.

### 0.12 Watermark semantics: applied vs durable

Options:
1) Treat durable == applied (simpler, defeats durability classes).
2) Track both separately and advance durable only after fsync and peer ACK.
3) Track per-peer ACKs and compute a "durable quorum watermark" for ReplicatedFsync(k).

Recommendation to lock now:
- applied watermark advances when apply_event is performed.
- durable watermark advances when the event is on local disk (fsync) for that replica,
  and when a peer ACKs durable for replicated durability.
- min_seen in receipts is the server's applied watermark map at the time it returns
  success (or at least at time of commit).

Rationale:
- Spec explicitly distinguishes applied and durable. If collapsed early, you will
  have to unwind it later across replication and IPC.

Risks if deferred:
- Inconsistent client behavior when using require_min_seen and retries after
  partial durability.

Modules impacted:
- new `src/core/watermark.rs`
- new `src/daemon/durability_coordinator.rs` (or similar)
- replication ACK handler (updates watermarks)
- checkpoint export (uses durable watermarks in meta.included)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- Lock which watermark vector gets written into checkpoint meta.included (spec: durable),
  and ensure checkpoint import advances durable watermarks accordingly.
- prev_sha256 continuity MUST be validated against the durable chain head (not applied).

Head sha tracking rule (normative):
- Whenever a watermark advances, StoreRuntime MUST also track the corresponding head sha
  (sha at that seq) for that (namespace, origin). This is required for:
  - prev_sha256 continuity checks for seq+1,
  - early divergence detection in replication handshakes/ACKs,
  - correctness after WAL pruning.

### 0.12.1 (Deferred in v0.5) Hash-chain continuity across pruning and checkpoint baselines

v0.5 defers WAL pruning. The included_heads anchor mechanism exists for future pruning,
but is not required for correctness in v0.5 because WAL segments are retained.

Deferred in v0.5:
- included_heads is optional in v0.5 and becomes required only when WAL pruning is enabled.

### 0.13 Replication integration: threads vs core

Options:
1) Replication threads mutate state directly.
2) Replication threads decode frames and send ingest messages to daemon thread
   which appends + applies + acks.
3) Use an async runtime and shared state (large architectural shift).

Recommendation to lock now: keep current architecture style: one coordinator thread
owns state. Replication sessions are threads that communicate via channels to
the daemon event loop. The daemon does: verify hash, WAL append, apply, update
watermarks, then emits ACK back via session channel.

Rationale:
- `src/daemon/core.rs` is already the serialization point. Keeping that invariant
  avoids race conditions between WAL, apply, and indexes.

Risks if deferred:
- You "temporarily" let replication apply events and later discover index
  corruption or watermark races.

Modules impacted:
- new `src/daemon/repl/*` (session, manager, server)
- `src/daemon/core.rs` (new ingress path for replication events)
- new `src/daemon/wal/*` (append during replication receive)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- Define backpressure and bounds at the channel boundary, so a fast peer cannot OOM
  the daemon by sending huge batches.
- When ingest queue is full, the session MUST apply backpressure by:
  - stopping reads (letting TCP backpressure kick in), OR
  - responding with ERROR(code="overloaded") and closing the connection.
  Silent unbounded buffering is forbidden.

### 0.14 IPC protocol evolution

Options:
1) Bump protocol and require clients to upgrade, keep Request enum strict.
2) Backward-compatible additions: optional fields with defaults, plus new ops.
3) Introduce a new IPC transport for streaming subscriptions.

Recommendation to lock now: do backward-compatible additions for mutation requests:
add `namespace: Option<String>`, `durability: Option<DurabilityClass>`,
`client_request_id: Option<String/Uuid>` with defaults. Keep IPC_PROTOCOL_VERSION
bump only when you introduce streaming responses (Subscribe).

Rationale:
- `src/daemon/ipc.rs` is the compatibility boundary. Optional fields are easy;
  streaming is the real protocol change.

Risks if deferred:
- You change CLI and daemon together and accidentally break scripting users, or
  add streaming ad hoc that interferes with request/response framing.

Modules impacted:
- `src/daemon/ipc.rs` (Request variants, Response payload to include receipt)
- `src/api/mod.rs` (receipt types)
- `src/cli/mod.rs` (flags -> request fields)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- Decide how receipts appear on failure paths (timeouts). Spec suggests a retryable
  error including receipt. This needs a clear ErrorPayload extension strategy.

Error payload standardization (normative):
- All error codes and payloads MUST conform to REALTIME_ERRORS.md.
- ErrorPayload shape: `{ code: string, message: string, retryable: bool, retry_after_ms?: u64, details?: object, receipt?: DurabilityReceipt }`
- IPC error responses MUST use this payload shape (JSON).
- Replication ERROR frames MUST use the same payload shape (CBOR).
- Error codes are stable once added (never removed, never renamed); new codes may be added.
- Clients MUST handle unknown codes gracefully (treat as non-retryable unless `retryable=true`).

### 0.15 Git checkpoint lane redesign

Options:
1) Incrementally morph `src/git/sync.rs` into checkpoint import/export while keeping typestate.
2) Keep `git/sync.rs` as legacy lane and add `src/git/checkpoint/*` fresh.
3) Replace the whole git subsystem at once (high risk).

Recommendation to lock now: keep `src/git/sync.rs` as legacy and implement new
checkpoint modules in `src/git/checkpoint/*` as the plan says, with a clean API:
`export_checkpoint(StoreState, included_watermarks) -> tree`,
`import_checkpoint(tree) -> StoreState + included_watermarks`.

Rationale:
- `git/sync.rs` writes a single ref with monolithic files. The new spec requires
  sharded layout, manifest.json, meta.json with hashes, new refs, and discovery ref.
  Evolving the existing layout risks mixing formats.

Risks if deferred:
- You create half-checkpoints where some pieces follow the old layout and some follow
  the new, making import verification and determinism difficult.

Modules impacted:
- new `src/git/checkpoint/*` (layout, manifest, meta, export, import)
- `src/git/sync.rs` (becomes migration reader or removed later)
- `src/git/wire.rs` (likely reused for checkpoint JSONL lines, not for layout)
- `src/daemon/core.rs` (checkpoint scheduler replaces sync scheduler)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- Lock the checkpoint JSONL record schema. If you keep the current sparse `_v`
  format (recommended for continuity), state it explicitly so checkpoint and
  delta conversion can share logic.

### 0.16 Migration boundary (legacy to realtime)

Options:
1) Convert legacy git state into snapshot event per namespace (spec rejects snapshot-as-event).
2) Import legacy git state into StoreState and treat as baseline, then start WAL at origin_seq=0.
3) Reconstruct historical event log (not feasible, not required).

Recommendation to lock now: migration imports legacy state as initial checkpoint baseline
("seed snapshot") and starts WAL sequencing fresh. No synthetic historical deltas.
Persist StoreMeta and initial watermarks accordingly.

Rationale:
- Realtime correctness depends on deterministic apply of deltas from a baseline.
  Baseline can be a checkpoint. No need to fabricate history.

Risks if deferred:
- You waste time fabricating fake events and end up with incorrect stamps or broken idempotency.

Modules impacted:
- `src/daemon/wal.rs` (legacy snapshot WAL import, read-only)
- `src/git/sync.rs` + `src/git/wire.rs` (legacy ref import path)
- new checkpoint import path (seed baseline)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- Decide initial watermarks after importing a checkpoint. They should reflect
  "everything in checkpoint is applied and durable" for the origins represented,
  or you risk immediate replication gaps.

### 0.17 ActorId vs ReplicaId

Options:
1) Replace ActorId with ReplicaId everywhere.
2) Keep ActorId for stamps and provenance, ReplicaId only for event_id sequencing.
3) Encode both into stamps.

Recommendation to lock now: keep ActorId unchanged for LWW stamps. ReplicaId is
transport/durability identity only.

Rationale:
- CRDT ordering uses `Stamp { at: WriteStamp, by: ActorId }` with deterministic
  tie-break. This is independent of replication identity.

Risks if deferred:
- You rewrite core CRDT types and wire formats unnecessarily and create awkward UX
  for created_by/deleted_by fields.

Modules impacted:
- `src/core/time.rs` (Stamp ties to ActorId)
- `src/core/identity.rs` (add ReplicaId/StoreId/TxnId without touching ActorId)
- event delta schema (created_by fields remain strings)

What must be true to proceed safely:
- Decide how daemon selects ActorId by default (currently passed to Daemon::new(actor)).
  This remains; replication must not treat actor strings as replica identity.

### 0.18 Top 5 lock-now list

If you want a top 5 lock-now list for early argument and alignment, it is:
- StoreId as the sole correctness identity (RemoteUrl is legacy discovery only).
- StoreState = namespaced map of CanonicalState (CanonicalState stays unchanged).
- origin_seq allocation inside WAL append via SQLite-backed counter semantics.
- EventBody bytes hashed and stored/forwarded unchanged; sha/prev live in headers.
- New checkpoint lane modules, leaving existing git sync as legacy/migration only.

---

## 0.19 Normative defaults and safety bounds (from spec)

These defaults are not optional; implementations MUST enforce bounds.

- MAX_FRAME_BYTES default 16 MiB.
- MAX_EVENT_BATCH_EVENTS default 10,000.
- MAX_EVENT_BATCH_BYTES default 10 MiB.
- KEEPALIVE_MS default 5s.
- DEAD_MS default 30s.
- WAL_SEGMENT_MAX_BYTES default 32 MiB.
- WAL_SEGMENT_MAX_AGE default 60s.
- MAX_WAL_RECORD_BYTES MUST be enforced; default <= 16 MiB.
- WAL_GUARDRAIL_MAX_BYTES default 8 GiB (warn only; WAL pruning remains deferred).
- WAL_GUARDRAIL_MAX_SEGMENTS default 10,000 (warn only; WAL pruning remains deferred).
- WAL_GUARDRAIL_GROWTH_WINDOW_MS default 10 minutes.
- WAL_GUARDRAIL_GROWTH_MAX_BYTES default 512 MiB per window (warn only).

Content-level limits (normative defaults; can be tightened per-namespace):
- MAX_NOTE_BYTES default 64 KiB (reject larger note_append content).
- MAX_OPS_PER_TXN default 10,000 (sum across bead/deps/notes ops).
- MAX_NOTE_APPENDS_PER_TXN default 1,000.
- MAX_LABELS_PER_BEAD default 256 (apply-time enforcement).

- WAL_GROUP_COMMIT_MAX_LATENCY_MS default 2ms (0 disables group commit).
- WAL_GROUP_COMMIT_MAX_EVENTS default 64.
- WAL_GROUP_COMMIT_MAX_BYTES default 1 MiB.
- MAX_SNAPSHOT_BYTES default 512 MiB (deferred in v0.5; applies to future snapshot bootstrap).
- MAX_CONCURRENT_SNAPSHOTS default 1 per store (deferred in v0.5).

CBOR decoding limits (normative):
- MAX_CBOR_DEPTH default 32 (prevents pathological nesting).
- MAX_CBOR_MAP_ENTRIES default 10,000 (prevents resource exhaustion during decode).
- MAX_CBOR_ARRAY_ENTRIES default 10,000.
- MAX_CBOR_BYTES_STRING_LEN default 16 MiB (must be <= MAX_FRAME_BYTES and <= MAX_WAL_RECORD_BYTES).
- MAX_CBOR_TEXT_STRING_LEN default 16 MiB (same bound as bytes strings).
- Reject payloads exceeding these limits before fully decoding.

Clock/HLC safety (normative defaults):
- HLC_MAX_FORWARD_DRIFT_MS default 600_000 (10 minutes).
- This check applies ONLY within a continuous daemon session, not across restarts.
- On startup: initialize last_physical_ms = max(persisted_last_physical_ms, system_time_ms).
  This anchors the HLC to "now" if the daemon was offline for any duration.
- On mint (after startup): if system_time_ms > last_physical_ms + HLC_MAX_FORWARD_DRIFT_MS,
  clamp physical_ms to last_physical_ms + HLC_MAX_FORWARD_DRIFT_MS, increment logical,
  and emit a warning + metric.
- Rationale: protects against VM resume or NTP step mid-session; does not penalize
  normal "came back after vacation" restarts.

Definite-length rule (normative for hashed structures):
- EventBody and EventFrameV1 decoding MUST reject indefinite-length maps/arrays/strings.

Internal backpressure defaults (normative):
- MAX_IPC_INFLIGHT_MUTATIONS default 1024 (reject or apply backpressure when exceeded).
- MAX_REPL_INGEST_QUEUE_BYTES default 32 MiB per session (bounded channel).
- MAX_REPL_INGEST_QUEUE_EVENTS default 50,000 per session.
- MAX_CHECKPOINT_JOB_QUEUE default 8 per store (coalesce by group when full).

Hot-path streaming cache (recommended defaults):
- EVENT_HOT_CACHE_MAX_BYTES default 64 MiB per store (0 disables).
- EVENT_HOT_CACHE_MAX_EVENTS default 200,000 per store (0 disables).
- MAX_BROADCAST_SUBSCRIBERS default 256 (reject additional subscribers).

Overload shedding (new, normative):
- Add AdmissionController that enforces priority:
  1) local IPC mutations
  2) replication ingest
  3) WANT servicing
  4) checkpoint/scrub serving
- When overloaded:
  - replication sessions MUST stop reads or close with ERROR(code="overloaded")
  - IPC mutations MAY return ERROR(code="overloaded") only when MAX_IPC_INFLIGHT_MUTATIONS exceeded
    (local mutations are highest priority; prefer shedding replication first)

I/O budgeting defaults (normative; may be tightened):
- MAX_REPL_INGEST_BYTES_PER_SEC default 64 MiB/s per session (token bucket; 0 disables).
- MAX_BACKGROUND_IO_BYTES_PER_SEC default 128 MiB/s per store for checkpoint/scrub work.
- Priority rule (normative): WAL append+fsync for local mutations MUST NOT be starved by
  background jobs. Background jobs MUST yield when budgets are exhausted.

---

## 1) Build dependencies and crate wiring (compile shaping)

These changes are prerequisites for the core types and WAL/replication.

### 1.1 Add dependencies (Cargo)

Update `Cargo.toml` with required categories:
- `uuid` (with serde feature) for StoreId/ReplicaId/TxnId
- `minicbor` (and optional derive helpers)
- `rusqlite` for WAL index
- `crc32c` for WAL and replication framing
- Existing: `sha2`, `hex`, `serde`, `serde_json`, `thiserror`
- Performance (recommended):
  - `bytes` for cheap shared byte buffers in replication/WAL streaming
  - `memmap2` (optional) for zero-copy segment reads in stream_range_bytes
- Observability (recommended for production operability):
  - `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber`
  - optional: `metrics` + exporter (Prometheus or log-based)

### 1.2 Core module exports

Update `src/core/mod.rs` (and `src/lib.rs` if needed) to re-export:
- identity additions (StoreId, ReplicaId, TxnId, EventId)
- namespace
- watermark
- event
- durability
- apply
- store_state (if split out)
- error (ErrorCode + ErrorPayload; see REALTIME_ERRORS.md)

---

## 2) Core domain model changes (src/core/*)

These are shared by daemon, git, IPC, and CLI.

### 2.1 Identity and store metadata

Add newtypes and identifiers in `src/core/identity.rs`:
- `StoreId(uuid::Uuid)`
- `ReplicaId(uuid::Uuid)`
- `TxnId(uuid::Uuid)`
- `ClientRequestId(uuid::Uuid)` // client-provided idempotency token
- `StoreEpoch(u64)`
- `SegmentId(uuid::Uuid)` // WAL segment identity, stable join key for indexing/repair
- `EventId { origin_replica_id: ReplicaId, namespace: NamespaceId, origin_seq: u64 }`

Add store metadata struct for on-disk identity, prefer `src/core/store_meta.rs`:
- `StoreMeta { store_id, store_epoch, replica_id, store_format_version,
               wal_format_version, checkpoint_format_version,
               replication_protocol_version, index_schema_version, created_at_ms }`
- `index_schema_version`: wal.sqlite schema version for in-place migrations

Additional spec-derived identity rules:
- `store_id` is generated once at store init and persisted in meta.json.
- `store_epoch` exists and starts at 0; it only changes on explicit reset.
- For repo-backed stores, `refs/beads/meta` contains `store_meta.json` with:
  - checkpoint_format_version
  - store_id
  - store_epoch
  - checkpoint_groups: { group_name -> git_ref } (map keys sorted)
- `store_slug` (if present) is a human alias and not a stable identifier.

Rationale:
- Current system keys state by RemoteUrl and repo path, which is unstable.
- Realtime replication requires stable IDs and a store epoch for invalidation.

### 2.1.1 Replica ID collision handling (normative)

Copying `$BD_DATA_DIR/stores/<store_id>/` to another machine duplicates `replica_id`,
which can cause event_id collisions and equivocation. This is an operational hazard.

Prevention and detection:
- On startup, the daemon SHOULD check if `replica_id` appears in the peer roster
  (if replicas.toml exists) as a different peer and emit a warning.
- On replication handshake, if `peer_replica_id == local_replica_id`, the daemon
  MUST reject the connection with ERROR(code="replica_id_collision").

Recovery:
- Provide `admin.rotate_replica_id` IPC operation:
  - Generates a new replica_id (UUID).
  - Updates meta.json.
  - Logs the old -> new mapping for traceability.
- After rotation, the replica starts with origin_seq = 0 for the new identity.
  Existing events authored by the old replica_id remain valid and attributed to
  the old identity.

### 2.1.2 Replica roster (strongly recommended; normative for durability/pruning)

Add store-local roster file:
- Path: `$BD_DATA_DIR/stores/<store_id>/replicas.toml`

Roster record fields (minimum viable):
- replica_id: UUID
- name: string (human label)
- role: anchor | peer | observer
- durability_eligible: bool  // counts toward ReplicatedFsync(k) and pruning safety gates
- allowed_namespaces: [string] (optional; if present, restrict replication scope)
- expire_after_ms: u64 (optional; if set, replica may be treated as inactive if not seen recently)

Semantics:
- If replicas.toml exists, inbound replication from unknown replica_id MUST be rejected with
  ERROR(code="unknown_replica") (non-cryptographic safety rail to prevent miswiring).
- DurabilityCoordinator MUST select eligible replicas from roster where durability_eligible=true
  and namespace policy allows replication.
- WAL pruning MUST treat replicas as "active" only if (now_ms - last_seen_ms) <= expire_after_ms
  (or if expire_after_ms is absent, treat as always active).
- The daemon SHOULD persist last_seen_ms for known replicas so pruning and admin.status remain correct
  across restarts (see wal.sqlite schema addition below).

### 2.2 Namespaces and policies

Add `src/core/namespace.rs`:
- `NamespaceId(String)` validation `[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,31}`
- `NamespacePolicy` fields:
  - persist_to_git: bool
  - replicate_mode: none | anchors | peers | p2p
  - retention: forever | ttl:<duration> | size:<bytes>
  - ready_eligible: bool
  - visibility: normal | pinned
  - gc_authority: checkpoint_writer | explicit_replica:<replica_id> | none
  - ttl_basis: last_mutation_stamp | event_time | explicit_field
- `CheckpointGroup` config:
  - namespaces included
  - git remote/ref
  - writer set, primary writer
  - debounce, max interval, max events
  - durable_copy_via_git

Defaults (from spec):
- core: persist_to_git=true, replicate=peers, retention=forever, ready_eligible=true,
  visibility=normal, gc_authority=checkpoint_writer, ttl_basis=last_mutation_stamp
- sys: persist_to_git=true, replicate=anchors, retention=forever, ready_eligible=false,
  visibility=pinned, gc_authority=checkpoint_writer, ttl_basis=last_mutation_stamp
- wf: persist_to_git=false, replicate=anchors, retention=ttl:7d, ready_eligible=false,
  visibility=normal, gc_authority=checkpoint_writer, ttl_basis=last_mutation_stamp
- tmp: persist_to_git=false, replicate=none, retention=ttl:24h, ready_eligible=false,
  visibility=normal, gc_authority=none

Rationale:
- Namespaces are first-class; retrofitting them later breaks indexing and queries.

### 2.3 Watermarks

Add `src/core/watermark.rs`:
- `WatermarkMap = BTreeMap<NamespaceId, BTreeMap<ReplicaId, u64>>`
  (deterministic ordering)
- `WatermarkHeadMap = BTreeMap<NamespaceId, BTreeMap<ReplicaId, [u8; 32]>>`
  where each entry is the sha256 of the event at the corresponding watermark seq.

Head sha invariant (normative):
- If `watermarks_*[ns][origin] == 0`, then the head sha MAY be absent for that origin.
- If `watermarks_*[ns][origin] > 0`, then the head sha MUST be known (from WAL, index,
  or checkpoint included_heads) before accepting (ns,origin,seq+1) events.

Helpers:
- `get(ns, origin) -> u64` (default 0)
- `advance_contiguous(ns, origin, new_seq)`
- `merge_max(other)`

Use cases:
- ACK semantics for replication
- Checkpoint inclusion proof
- Durability receipts (min_seen)
- Subscription gating (require_min_seen)
- Early divergence detection in replication handshakes/ACKs

### 2.4 Event bodies and deltas (v0.5)

Add `src/core/event.rs`:

EventBody fields (spec-aligned; v0.5 hashed payload):
- envelope_v
- store_id, store_epoch, namespace
- origin_replica_id, origin_seq
- event_time_ms, txn_id, client_request_id: Option<ClientRequestId>
- hlc_max: HlcMax (required for TxnV1; see HLC max rule below)
- kind, delta

HlcMax structure:
- actor_id: ActorId
- physical_ms: u64
- logical: u32

Event linkage fields (not inside EventBody in v0.5):
- sha256: bytes(32) computed as SHA256(event_body_bytes)
- prev_sha256: optional bytes(32) stored in WAL record header / replication frame header

ClientRequestId scope rule:
- client_request_id uniqueness and idempotency MUST be scoped to:
  (namespace, origin_replica_id, client_request_id).
  It MUST NOT be treated as globally unique within a store.

EventKind:
- TxnV1

DeltaV1:
- TxnDeltaV1 (the default for client mutations; carries 0..N ops)

TxnDeltaV1 contains operation lists (all intra-namespace):
- bead_upserts: Vec<WireBeadPatch>
- bead_deletes: Vec<{ id, deleted_at, deleted_by, ... }>
- dep_upserts: Vec<{ from, to, kind, created_at, created_by, deleted_at?, deleted_by? }>
- dep_deletes: Vec<{ from, to, kind, deleted_at, deleted_by }>
- note_appends: Vec<{ note_id, bead_id, content, author, at }>

Limits (normative):
- note_append.content MUST be <= MAX_NOTE_BYTES.
- Total ops in TxnDeltaV1 MUST be <= MAX_OPS_PER_TXN (reject at mutation planning and at replication ingest).

Event-time rule:
- `event_time_ms` MUST equal the physical wall time used to mint the write stamp
  for the mutation that produced this event.
- If delta contains multiple new stamps, event_time_ms MUST be >= the max wall time
  and SHOULD equal it.

HLC max rule (normative):
- For TxnV1 events, `hlc_max` MUST be present. Events missing hlc_max MUST be rejected
  at decode time (not at apply time) with a decoding/validation error.
- `hlc_max` MUST equal the maximum stamp minted in the txn for the effective ActorId.
- This field exists to support fast, correct HLC recovery after restart or index rebuild.

Hash rules (v0.5):
- event_body_bytes is the canonical CBOR encoding of EventBody.
- sha256 MUST be computed over event_body_bytes exactly.
- prev_sha256 (if present in headers) MUST match the previous sha256 for the same
  (origin_replica_id, namespace).

Delta guidance:
- TxnDeltaV1 `bead_upserts` should omit notes; notes replicate via `note_appends`.
- A `bead_upsert` that includes notes is interpreted as "at least these notes exist"
  (set-union), never truncation.
- Locally-authored dep ops MUST include explicit stamps (created_at/created_by and
  deleted_at/deleted_by), typically equal to the event stamp, so canonical CBOR
  bytes are deterministic and replay/replication are stable.
- `note_append` carries note id, content, author, stamp.
- `bead_delete` includes deletion stamp and lineage fields if present.
- `dep_upsert` and `dep_delete` include from/to/kind and life stamps.
- `dep_upsert`/`dep_delete` are intra-namespace only; cross-namespace is rejected.

Namespace GC marker events are deferred in v0.5.

### 2.5 Wire bead representations

Add `src/core/wire_bead.rs`:
- `WireBeadFull` for checkpoint snapshots (all fields present)
- `WireBeadPatch` for deltas (mutable fields as Option<T>)

WireBead field names match legacy git wire (sparse `_v` format) to allow shared
conversion logic:
- core: id, key?, created_at, created_by, created_on_branch?
- fields: title, description, design?, acceptance_criteria?, priority, type, labels,
  external_ref?, source_repo?, estimated_minutes?
- workflow: status, closed_at?, closed_by?, closed_reason?, closed_on_branch?
- claim: assignee?, assignee_at?, assignee_expires?
- notes? (note objects: id, content, author, at)
- version metadata: _at, _by, _v?

### 2.6 Durability semantics (v0.5)

Add `src/core/durability.rs`:
- `DurabilityClass`:
  - LocalFsync
  - ReplicatedFsync { k: u32 }
- `DurabilityProofV1` (normative, extensible):
  - local_fsync: { at_ms: u64, durable_seq: WatermarkMap }  // proof of local disk durability
  - replicated: Option<{ k: u32, acked_by: Vec<ReplicaId> }>
- `DurabilityReceipt`:
  - store_id, store_epoch, txn_id, events: Vec<EventId>
  - requested_class: DurabilityClass
  - durability_proof: DurabilityProofV1
  - achieved_class: Option<DurabilityClass>  // derived convenience only
  - min_seen: WatermarkMap

Receipt semantics:
- min_seen is applied watermarks at response/commit time.
- If waiting for durability times out but local append succeeded, return a retryable
  error including receipt.

### 2.7 Namespaced store state

Add `StoreState = BTreeMap<NamespaceId, CanonicalState>` in
`src/core/state.rs` or `src/core/store_state.rs`.
Add helpers:
- `ns()` / `ns_mut()`
- `core()` / `core_mut()` convenience for legacy paths

Rule:
- Global indexes keyed by BeadId/DepKey/TombstoneKey remain per-namespace by
  containment, not by altering key types.

### 2.8 Write stamps (explicit requirements)

Write stamps are used only for conflict resolution (not replication progress).
They must be monotonic per actor on a replica and totally ordered by
(physical_ms, logical_counter, actor_id tie-break).

Persistence requirement (normative):
- The daemon MUST persist enough HLC state to prevent stamp regression after restart
  or wall-clock rollback. At minimum, persist (last_physical_ms, last_logical)
  for the daemon's active ActorId.
- On startup, initialize the HLC from persisted state.
- On mint, if system_time_ms < last_physical_ms, clamp physical_ms to last_physical_ms
  and increment logical_counter.

Forward-jump handling (normative):
- On startup: initialize last_physical_ms = max(persisted_last_physical_ms, system_time_ms).
- On mint (after startup), if system_time_ms > last_physical_ms + HLC_MAX_FORWARD_DRIFT_MS,
  clamp physical_ms to last_physical_ms + HLC_MAX_FORWARD_DRIFT_MS and increment logical_counter.
- The daemon MUST log this as a clock anomaly and include it in admin.status/admin.doctor
  (e.g., last_clock_anomaly_at_ms, last_clock_anomaly_kind, last_clock_anomaly_delta_ms).

Recovery requirement (normative):
- If the SQLite index is rebuilt or missing, the daemon MUST reconstruct HLC state
  by scanning locally-authored WAL records and taking max(hlc_max) per ActorId.
- This MUST NOT require decoding full deltas; it should use `hlc_max` from EventBody.

---

## 3) Canonical CBOR with minicbor (v0.5)

We will use `minicbor` directly for hashed payloads. `minicbor_serde` is allowed
for non-hashed messages only.

### 3.1 Canonical encoding requirements (Beads canonical CBOR)

Beads uses a fixed key ordering for deterministic hashing, not RFC 8949 canonical CBOR.
This is simpler to implement correctly and just as deterministic.

**Base requirements:**
- Definite-length maps and arrays only.
- No floats in EventBody.
- Reject non-canonical integer encodings (non-minimal additional bytes).
- Reject any CBOR tags in EventBody.
- Reject duplicate map keys.

**Fixed key ordering (normative):**

Writers MUST emit map keys in the exact order specified below. Readers MUST NOT
reject based on key order (for forward compatibility with potential relaxation).

**EventBody map keys (in emission order):**
```
1.  "client_request_id"   (optional, skip if None)
2.  "delta"
3.  "envelope_v"
4.  "event_time_ms"
5.  "hlc_max"             (required for TxnV1)
6.  "kind"
7.  "namespace"
8.  "origin_replica_id"
9.  "origin_seq"
10. "store_epoch"
11. "store_id"
12. "txn_id"
```

**TxnDeltaV1 map keys (in emission order):**
```
1. "bead_upserts"
2. "bead_deletes"
3. "dep_upserts"
4. "dep_deletes"
5. "note_appends"
6. "v"
```

**NoteAppend entry keys (in emission order):**
```
1. "bead_id"
2. "note"
```

**HlcMax keys (in emission order):**
```
1. "actor_id"
2. "logical"
3. "physical_ms"
```

### 3.2 Encoding strategy (v0.5)
- Implement `EventBody::encode_canonical_bytes()` using `minicbor::Encoder`.
- Emit keys in the fixed order specified in §3.1 (no runtime sorting required).
- Implement:
  - `encode_canonical_body()` -> event_body_bytes
  - `compute_sha256(event_body_bytes)` -> sha256
  - WAL + wire always carry `event_body_bytes` plus sha/prev in frame headers

### 3.3 Why not minicbor_serde for hashing
- Serde does not guarantee canonical key ordering.
- Canonical ordering is required for tamper-evident hashes.

### 3.4 EventBody validation on decode (normative, v0.5)

Add `decode_event_body(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<EventBody, DecodeError>` and helpers:
- MUST enforce the CBOR decoding limits in 0.19.
- MUST reject indefinite-length and floats in EventBody.
- SHOULD reject duplicate keys (minicbor decoder behavior permitting).
- Hash verification is performed by the WAL/replication frame validator:
  - compute sha256 over raw bytes
  - compare to sha256 provided by the frame header

Implementation note:
- Validation should not require decoding full deltas for basic integrity checks.
  However, apply requires decoding deltas. The system may parse EventBody minimally
  for admission checks, then fully decode only when applying.

---

## 4) Deterministic event apply semantics (core)

Create a pure apply path so local mutations and remote events converge identically.

### 4.1 Apply module (`src/core/apply.rs`)

Add:
- `apply_event(ns_state: &mut CanonicalState, event: &EventBody)
   -> Result<ApplyOutcome, ApplyError>`

Add shared gating helpers:
- `should_apply(applied_seq: u64, incoming_seq: u64) -> ApplyGate`
  where ApplyGate is one of:
  - AlreadyApplied (no-op; do not call apply_event)
  - Gap (buffer/request; do not call apply_event)
  - ApplyNow (call apply_event, then advance applied watermark if contiguous)

ApplyOutcome should include:
- changed bead ids
- changed deps
- new notes
- (no watermark mutation; watermark advancement is owned by StoreRuntime)
- derived_dirty_shards (optional helper): the set of checkpoint shard ids (00..ff)
  affected by this event for beads/tombstones/deps in the namespace

Dep shard dirtiness (normative):
- For dep_upsert/dep_delete, ApplyOutcome.changed_deps MUST include the DepKey so
  checkpoint export can mark the correct deps shard as dirty using:
  dep_key_bytes = from "\0" to "\0" kind (UTF-8) and shard = sha256(dep_key_bytes)[0].

### 4.2 Merge rules (explicit, idempotent)

- bead_upsert:
  - Apply each field using LWW stamps.
  - If patch omits a field, leave it unchanged.
- bead_delete:
  - Merge tombstone with LWW semantics.
  - Ignore delete if older than live stamp (resurrection rule).
- dep_upsert / dep_delete:
  - Treat as LWW on DepLife.
  - Deletions should carry a delete stamp.
  - dep_delete is idempotent and MUST NOT error if the edge does not exist.
  - delete-before-create is valid and MUST converge (tombstone wins until newer upsert).
- note_append:
  - Insert note if id not present.
  - If same id exists with different content, treat as corruption.
Namespace GC marker apply is deferred in v0.5.

Idempotency:
- Idempotency MUST be enforced by StoreRuntime via watermarks before calling apply_event.
- apply_event MUST remain deterministic and side-effect-free with respect to watermarks.

Rationale:
- Event apply must be deterministic and idempotent across local and remote lanes.

## 5) Event WAL redesign (`src/daemon/wal/*`)

Replace the snapshot WAL with event WAL per namespace. Keep legacy WAL read-only.

### 5.1 File move: free the wal module name

Current `src/daemon/wal.rs` conflicts with planned `src/daemon/wal/` directory.
Rename to `src/daemon/wal_legacy_snapshot.rs`, update imports, keep read-only
for migration and one-release compatibility.

### 5.2 File layout and framing (spec-aligned)

Directory layout under store dir:
- `wal/<namespace>/segment-<created_at_ms>-<segment_id>.wal`
- `index/wal.sqlite`
- `snap/` reserved for snapshot bootstrap temp files (deferred in v0.5)

#### 5.2.1 Segment header (normative binary layout)

All multi-byte integers are little-endian. Magic is raw ASCII bytes.

```
Offset  Size  Type       Field
------  ----  ---------  -----
0       5     ASCII      SEGMENT_MAGIC = "BDWAL"
5       4     u32_le     WAL_FORMAT_VERSION = 2
9       4     u32_le     header_len (total header bytes including crc32c)
13      16    UUID       store_id (raw bytes, not string)
29      8     u64_le     store_epoch
37      4     u32_le     namespace_len
41      var   UTF-8      namespace_bytes (namespace_len bytes)
41+N    8     u64_le     created_at_ms
49+N    16    UUID       segment_id (stable identity for indexing/repair)
65+N    4     u32_le     flags (reserved = 0)
69+N    4     u32_le     header_crc32c (CRC-32C of bytes 0..(69+N), excludes this field)
```

Minimum header size (empty namespace): 73 bytes. Typical with "core" (4 bytes): 77 bytes.

#### 5.2.2 Frame format (normative binary layout)

Each record is wrapped in a frame with integrity checking:

```
Offset  Size  Type       Field
------  ----  ---------  -----
0       4     u32_le     FRAME_MAGIC = 0x42445232 ("BDR2")
4       4     u32_le     length (body bytes only, not frame header)
8       4     u32_le     crc32c (CRC-32C of body only)
12      var   bytes      body (record_header + payload)
```

Frame header is always 12 bytes. Total frame size = 12 + length.

#### 5.2.3 Record header (normative binary layout, version 1)

```
Offset  Size  Type       Field
------  ----  ---------  -----
0       2     u16_le     RECORD_HEADER_VERSION = 1
2       2     u16_le     header_len (total record header bytes)
4       2     u16_le     flags (bit field, see below)
6       2     u16_le     reserved (MUST be 0)
8       16    UUID       origin_replica_id
24      8     u64_le     origin_seq
32      8     u64_le     event_time_ms
40      16    UUID       txn_id
56      [16]  UUID       client_request_id (if flags.bit1 set)
var     [32]  bytes      request_sha256 (if flags.bit2 set)
var     32    bytes      sha256 (always present)
var     [32]  bytes      prev_sha256 (if flags.bit0 set)
```

**Flags bitfield:**
- bit0: has_prev_sha (prev_sha256 present)
- bit1: has_client_request_id (client_request_id present)
- bit2: has_request_sha256 (request_sha256 present, local-only idempotency digest)
- bits 3-15: reserved (MUST be 0, reject if set)

Base header size: 88 bytes. Maximum with all optional fields: 88 + 16 + 32 + 32 = 168 bytes.

Payload follows immediately after record header: canonical CBOR bytes of EventBody.

Header consistency (normative):
- record_header fields MUST match the decoded EventBody fields.
- On mismatch, treat as corruption (fail unless repair mode).

Forward compatibility rule (normative):
- Readers MUST skip any unknown trailing bytes in the record header using record_header_len.
- Writers MUST set reserved=0 and MUST NOT rely on readers interpreting unknown fields.

Rotation triggers:
- max bytes (default 32 MiB)
- max age (default 60s)

Segment creation (normative):
- New segments MUST be created atomically:
  1) create `segment-<created_at_ms>-<segment_id>.wal.tmp` with O_EXCL,
  2) write the full segment header,
  3) fsync the temp file,
  4) rename to `.wal`,
  5) fsync the `wal/<namespace>/` directory.
- On startup, any `*.wal.tmp` files MUST be treated as incomplete segments and MUST NOT
  be replayed. Implementations SHOULD delete them after verifying they are not referenced
  by wal.sqlite (segments table).

Sealed segment invariant (normative):
- When a segment is rotated, it becomes sealed (immutable). The daemon MUST record:
  - sealed=1 and final_len (bytes) in wal.sqlite segments table.
- On startup, sealed segments MUST have `file_len == final_len`. If not, treat as
  corruption and fail fast (requires operator intervention).

Max record size:
- Must enforce MAX_WAL_RECORD_BYTES (default <= 16 MiB).
- Records larger than limit must be rejected at write time and error at read time.

Tail recovery:
- If EOF occurs mid-record, ignore partial tail and truncate to last valid boundary.
- If crc mismatch at tail, truncate to last valid boundary.
- If corruption is detected not at tail, fail with explicit error by default.

Online vs offline repair boundary (normative):
- While the daemon is accepting writes, it MUST ONLY perform tail truncation repairs
  (EOF mid-record, crc mismatch at tail).
- If corruption is detected not at tail, the daemon MUST fail fast and MUST NOT attempt
  mid-file resynchronization while live. It MUST emit an operator action: run offline fsck.

Offline repair (recommended):
- Provide an offline tool (library + CLI) `bd store fsck` that can be run when the daemon
  is stopped (or in maintenance/read-only mode). It:
  - scans wal/<ns> segments and validates headers, frame CRCs, sha256, prev_sha continuity,
    and per-(ns,origin) contiguity;
  - cross-checks wal.sqlite offsets (if present);
  - emits the same deterministic report schema as admin.doctor.
- `bd store fsck --repair` MAY perform bounded repairs:
  - truncate corrupted tails,
  - quarantine corrupted mid-file segments (move to wal/<ns>/quarantine/),
  - rebuild wal.sqlite from WAL (drop + rebuild).

### 5.3 WAL segment naming and meaning of first_seq

Segment filename: `segment-<created_at_ms>-<segment_id>.wal`:
- `created_at_ms` from segment header.
- `segment_id` from segment header.

`first_seq` is the origin_seq of the first record written to the segment (from any origin).
It SHOULD be cached in SQLite (segments table) for operator visibility.
Offline tools can derive it cheaply from the first record_header without decoding CBOR.

WAL index is authoritative for range serving and should not rely on filename
semantics beyond ordering.

### 5.4 WAL module structure

New files:
- `src/daemon/wal/mod.rs` (public API)
- `src/daemon/wal/segment.rs` (segment header and rotation)
- `src/daemon/wal/frame.rs` (crc32c framing)
- `src/daemon/wal/index.rs` (WalIndex trait + SQLite implementation)
- `src/daemon/wal/replay.rs` (scan, rebuild, truncate)
- `src/daemon/wal/error.rs` (WalError types)

Legacy:
- `src/daemon/wal_legacy_snapshot.rs` (read-only snapshot WAL)

### 5.5 EventWal API (example shape, locked)

```rust
pub struct EventWal { /* store_dir, index, open segments */ }

pub struct EventBytes {
  pub eid: EventId,
  pub sha: [u8; 32],
  pub prev_sha: Option<[u8; 32]>, // fast-path chain link (not in EventBody bytes)
  pub bytes: bytes::Bytes, // canonical CBOR EventBody bytes; MAY be a zero-copy view into an mmapped segment
}

/// Locally-produced event input. MUST omit origin_seq/sha/prev_sha.
pub struct EventDraft {
  pub body_without_ids: EventBody, // origin_seq=0; origin_replica_id set to local
}

pub struct AppendResult {
  pub event_ids: Vec<EventId>,
  pub shas: Vec<[u8; 32]>,
  pub bytes_written: u64,
}

impl EventWal {
  pub fn open(store_dir: &Path, meta: &StoreMeta) -> Result<Self, WalError>;
  /// Append locally-authored events (origin_replica_id == meta.replica_id).
  /// Allocates origin_seq and fills prev_sha256/sha256 deterministically.
  pub fn append_local(&mut self, ns: &NamespaceId, drafts: &[EventDraft])
    -> Result<AppendResult, WalError>;
  /// Ingest remote-authored events as-is using EventBody bytes received from the origin.
  /// The caller MUST enforce contiguity and prev_sha continuity before calling.
  pub fn ingest_remote_bytes(&mut self, ns: &NamespaceId, origin: &ReplicaId,
                             frames: &[EventBytes])
    -> Result<AppendResult, WalError>;
  pub fn fsync_namespace(&mut self, ns: &NamespaceId) -> Result<(), WalError>;
  pub fn stream_range_bytes(&self, ns: &NamespaceId, origin: &ReplicaId,
                            from_seq_exclusive: u64, max_bytes: usize)
    -> Result<Vec<EventBytes>, WalError>;
  pub fn stream_range(&self, ns: &NamespaceId, origin: &ReplicaId,
                      from_seq_exclusive: u64, max_bytes: usize)
    -> Result<Vec<EventBody>, WalError>; // convenience wrapper
  pub fn max_origin_seq(&self, ns: &NamespaceId, origin: &ReplicaId) -> Result<u64, WalError>;
  pub fn replay(&self, ns: &NamespaceId) -> Result<(), WalError>;
}
```

Implementation details:
- `append_local` allocates origin_seq (SQLite counter), sets prev_sha256 from a
  durable head cache (or index lookup on cold start), computes EventBody bytes + sha,
  writes frames, fsyncs per durability, records index entries, and returns assigned ids.
- `ingest_remote_bytes` does NOT allocate origin_seq and MUST NOT re-encode bytes.
  It writes validated EventBody bytes, records index entries, and returns ids.
- `stream_range` reads EventBody bytes from WAL and decodes (or streams bytes
  directly; still must validate hash).
- `replay` rebuilds in-memory state or index from WAL segments.

### 5.6 WAL append flow (authoritative)

Local append (authoritative):
1) Acquire per-namespace append lock.
2) Allocate origin_seq inside SQLite transaction (table-backed counter).
3) Resolve prev_sha256 for (ns, local_replica_id, origin_seq-1) from an in-memory
   head cache (populate at open; update on each successful fsync+commit).
4) Encode canonical EventBody bytes and compute sha256.
5) Write framed record(s) to active segment.
6) If new segment created, fsync directory once.
7) For LocalFsync or stronger, fsync active segment file.
8) Record event offsets + sha + prev_sha in SQLite and commit transaction.
9) Update in-memory head cache and return assigned EventIds.

Remote ingest (authoritative):
1) Caller enforces contiguity: origin_seq == durable_seen+1 and prev_sha matches
   the current head sha for (ns, origin).
2) Caller MUST decode EventBody (bounds + definite-length + no floats) and MUST verify:
   sha256(event_body_bytes) == frame_header.sha256, and EventBody fields match frame header
   (store_id, store_epoch, namespace, origin_replica_id, origin_seq, txn_id, client_request_id).
3) Acquire per-namespace append lock.
4) Write framed record(s) using provided canonical bytes (no re-encode).
5) Fsync per durability policy used for remote ingest (durable means "on disk here").
6) Record offsets + sha + prev_sha in SQLite and commit.
7) Advance durable/applied watermarks via StoreRuntime and update head cache.

### 5.7 (Deferred in v0.5) WAL pruning and retention enforcement

v0.5 does not prune WAL segments. Namespace retention policies are parsed and validated,
but enforcement via GC markers and segment deletion is deferred.
Guardrails (admin status + metrics) MUST surface WAL segment counts, total bytes, and
growth rates, and emit warnings when configured thresholds are exceeded.

Retention + pruning gates:
Deferred in v0.5 (requires WAL pruning work):
- GC marker emission
- GC floors
- pruning safety gates
- included_heads as a hard requirement

Receipt GC remains recommended for SQLite bloat control, but is independent of WAL pruning.

---

## 6) WAL index with SQLite (`src/daemon/wal/index.rs`)

SQLite is used as a rebuildable index, not the source of truth.

### 6.1 WalIndex trait (shape to lock)

```rust
pub trait WalIndex: Send + Sync {
  /// Returns a writer handle bound to the coordinator thread (single writer connection).
  fn writer(&self) -> Box<dyn WalIndexWriter>;
  /// Returns a reader handle usable by replication/admin threads (pooled read-only connections).
  fn reader(&self) -> Box<dyn WalIndexReader>;
}

pub trait WalIndexWriter {
  /// Begin a single atomic index update transaction (pairs with WAL append critical section).
  fn begin_txn(&self) -> Result<Box<dyn WalIndexTxn>, WalError>;
}

pub trait WalIndexTxn {
  fn next_origin_seq(&mut self, ns: &NamespaceId, origin: &ReplicaId) -> Result<u64, WalError>;
  fn record_event(&mut self, ns: &NamespaceId, eid: &EventId, sha: [u8; 32],
                  prev_sha: Option<[u8; 32]>,
                  segment_id: SegmentId, offset: u64, len: u32,
                  event_time_ms: u64, txn_id: TxnId,
                  client_request_id: Option<ClientRequestId>,
                  request_sha256: Option<[u8; 32]>)
    -> Result<(), WalError>;
  fn update_watermark(&mut self, ns: &NamespaceId, origin: &ReplicaId,
                      applied: u64, durable: u64,
                      applied_head_sha: Option<[u8; 32]>,
                      durable_head_sha: Option<[u8; 32]>) -> Result<(), WalError>;
  fn upsert_client_request(&mut self, ns: &NamespaceId, origin: &ReplicaId,
                           client_request_id: ClientRequestId,
                           request_sha256: [u8; 32],
                           txn_id: TxnId, event_ids: &[EventId],
                           created_at_ms: u64) -> Result<(), WalError>;
  fn commit(self: Box<Self>) -> Result<(), WalError>;
  fn rollback(self: Box<Self>) -> Result<(), WalError>;
}

pub trait WalIndexReader {
  fn lookup_event_sha(&self, ns: &NamespaceId, eid: &EventId)
    -> Result<Option<[u8; 32]>, WalError>;
  fn iter_from(&self, ns: &NamespaceId, origin: &ReplicaId, from_seq_excl: u64,
               max_bytes: usize) -> Result<Vec<IndexedRangeItem>, WalError>;
  fn lookup_client_request(&self, ns: &NamespaceId, origin: &ReplicaId,
                           client_request_id: ClientRequestId)
    -> Result<Option<ClientRequestRow>, WalError>;
  fn max_origin_seq(&self, ns: &NamespaceId, origin: &ReplicaId) -> Result<u64, WalError>;
}

pub struct ClientRequestRow {
  pub request_sha256: [u8; 32],
  pub txn_id: TxnId,
  pub event_ids: Vec<EventId>,
  pub created_at_ms: u64,
}
```

### 6.2 Minimal schema (example, spec-aligned)

```

```

**Table status (normative vs rebuildable):**

| Table | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| events | Normative, rebuildable | Index of WAL contents; rebuild from segments |
| watermarks | Normative, rebuildable | Derived from events table during rebuild |
| client_requests | Normative, rebuildable | Idempotency mapping; rebuild from WAL record headers |
| origin_seq | Normative, rebuildable | Counter; rebuild as max(origin_seq)+1 from events |
| meta | Normative, NOT rebuildable | Store identity; fail if mismatch |
| hlc | Normative, rebuildable | HLC state; rebuild from max(hlc_max) in WAL |
| segments | Normative, rebuildable | Segment metadata; rebuild from filesystem scan |
| replica_liveness | Volatile, rebuildable | Observability cache; safe to drop |

**event_ids encoding (normative):**

The `event_ids` column in `client_requests` is CBOR-encoded:
```
event_ids := CBOR array of EventId
EventId := CBOR array(3) [
  origin_replica_id: bytes(16),  // UUID raw bytes
  namespace: text,               // UTF-8 string
  origin_seq: u64                // positive integer
]
```

**Note:** `request_sha256` is stored in `client_requests` only, NOT in `events`.
This is intentional: the request digest is for idempotency checking, not event indexing.

**General encoding notes:**
- UUIDs stored as 16-byte BLOBs (not string representation).
- Under the "one request → one event" rule, event_ids is typically length 1,
  but remains a Vec for forward compatibility.
- meta stores schema version and store_id for sanity checks.

Startup sanity checks (normative):
- On every store open (even when index exists), the daemon MUST verify:
  - meta.store_id/store_epoch match StoreMeta (fail fast if mismatch).
  - For each segments row: last_indexed_offset <= current file length, else treat
    as index corruption and force rebuild for that namespace.
  - origin_seq.next_seq >= (max(origin_seq) observed in events table) + 1, else
    recompute origin_seq from events table (or full WAL scan if events table missing).
- If any check fails, rebuild the index from WAL segments before allowing appends.

Pending receipt reconciliation:
- Removed in v0.5. There is no PENDING/COMMITTED state machine.

### 6.3 Semantics

- WAL is authoritative; SQLite can be dropped and rebuilt.
- On startup, if index is missing or version mismatched, scan WAL segments to rebuild.
- On startup, if index exists, perform incremental catch-up:
  for each segment, if file_len > segments.last_indexed_offset,
  scan frames from last_indexed_offset to EOF and index any valid records.
  Apply tail-truncation rules if partial/corrupt tail is encountered.
- `client_request_id` lookups provide idempotency without scanning WAL.
- Equivocation: if same EventId exists with different sha, treat as protocol error.
- origin_seq allocation is authoritative in SQLite but rebuildable from WAL.

### 6.4 Transaction boundaries

- origin_seq allocation, WAL write, and record_event indexing must happen in a single
  critical section and be committed together.
- SQLite transactions must not be committed before WAL fsync (for LocalFsync).

SQLite PRAGMA choices (normative):
- `journal_mode = WAL` for concurrent reads during writes.
- Add explicit `index_durability_mode = cache | durable` (store-local setting).
  - cache (default): `synchronous = NORMAL`. SQLite is treated as rebuildable cache.
    Correctness and client durability promises derive from WAL segments + replay.
  - durable (opt-in): `synchronous = FULL`. Stronger persistence for idempotency mapping/index,
    at a cost in tail latency.
  In both modes, open-time index catch-up + origin_seq recompute is mandatory.
- `cache_size = -16000` (16 MiB cache) or configurable.
- `busy_timeout = 5000` (or configurable) to avoid spurious SQLITE_BUSY under load.
- `foreign_keys = ON` (defensive, even if schema uses few FKs initially).
- Document these choices explicitly; do not rely on SQLite defaults.

SQLite bloat control (recommended):
- Set `auto_vacuum = INCREMENTAL` at DB creation time (must be set before tables exist).
- After idempotency mapping GC, run bounded `PRAGMA incremental_vacuum(N)` where N is derived from
  MAX_BACKGROUND_IO_BYTES_PER_SEC to prevent WAL/index files from growing forever.
- Periodically run `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` (for wal.sqlite's own -wal file)
  in the background, also bounded by MAX_BACKGROUND_IO_BYTES_PER_SEC.
- Suggested frequency: after every N idempotency mapping GC operations OR every M minutes, whichever
  comes first (defaults: N=1000, M=60).

Schema migration policy (normative):
- If meta.index_schema_version < binary-supported schema version:
  - for additive migrations (new tables/columns): perform in-place migration at startup,
    then update meta.index_schema_version.
  - for incompatible migrations: refuse to start in write mode until operator runs
    admin.rebuild_index (or explicit `admin.migrate_index --rebuild`).

### 6.5 Crash-consistency contract (normative)

The daemon MUST preserve the following ordering for any locally-authored mutation:

Local append ordering:
1) Allocate origin_seq inside a SQLite write transaction.
2) Write WAL record bytes to the active segment.
3) If durability >= LocalFsync: fsync the segment file (and fsync directory only on new segment creation).
4) Record event offsets + sha + prev_sha AND idempotency mapping in SQLite (same transaction) and COMMIT.
5) Apply event to in-memory state.
6) Update applied watermark (in memory) and persist watermarks in SQLite.
7) Only after step (6) may a success response be returned.

Failure handling:
- If failure occurs before step (3): no durability is promised; WAL tail may be truncated on restart.
- If failure occurs after step (3) but before step (4): WAL may contain a durable record not indexed.
  This is expected in `index_durability_mode=cache`. Startup MUST catch up/rebuild the index
  from WAL before accepting writes to avoid origin_seq reuse and to restore idempotency lookups.
- If failure occurs after step (4) but before step (5): restart replay MUST apply the event.
- If failure occurs after step (5) but before step (6): event is applied in memory but
  SQLite watermark persistence may lag. On restart, replay recomputes applied state,
  and the index catch-up restores idempotency mapping from WAL record headers.

Serve-traffic gate:
- The daemon MUST NOT accept mutation requests until WAL verification + index catch-up + replay complete,
  unless explicitly started in read-only / maintenance mode.

---

## 7) Store runtime in daemon (`src/daemon/*`)

Add a per-store runtime struct that owns state, WAL, watermarks, and coordination.

### 7.1 StoreRuntime shape (locked)

```rust
pub struct StoreRuntime {
  meta: StoreMeta,
  policies: NamespacePolicySet,
  state: StoreState,
  wal: EventWal,
  wal_index_reader: Box<dyn WalIndexReader>, // fast WANT/admin reads without blocking coordinator
  watermarks_applied: WatermarkMap,
  watermarks_durable: WatermarkMap,
  /// Fast chain heads: last durable sha per (ns, origin). Used for prev_sha fill
  /// and for gap validation without decoding EventBody bytes.
  head_sha: BTreeMap<NamespaceId, BTreeMap<ReplicaId, [u8; 32]>>,
  gc: GcRuntime, // retention enforcement + WAL pruning (deferred) + idempotency mapping GC
  gap_buffer: GapBufferByNsOrigin,
  peer_acks: PeerAckTable,
  broadcaster: EventBroadcaster,
  idempotency: IdempotencyStore,
  checkpoint: CheckpointRuntime, // worker thread + job queue + last results
  scrubber: ScrubberRuntime,     // periodic WAL/index health checks + metrics
  admission: AdmissionController, // global priority + overload shedding (new)
}
```

### 7.2 Daemon integration

- `Daemon` becomes keyed by StoreId instead of RemoteUrl.
- Maintain `path_to_store_id` mapping for repo-bound operations.
- Maintain `remote_to_store_id` mapping for Git lane compatibility.
- Keep git-specific RepoState keyed by store id and checkpoint group.
- `core.rs` remains the serialization point for apply/ingest.

### 7.3 Startup flow (store open)

1) Determine StoreId using discovery order (spec 2.1.1):
   - local store dir meta.json
   - refs/beads/meta store_meta.json
   - refs/beads/<store_id>/* listing (manual selection if multiple)
   - UUIDv5(normalized_remote_url) fallback for migration only
2) Ensure store dir exists and acquire store-global lock.
3) Load or create StoreMeta (replica_id stable on disk).
4) Load namespaces.toml and validate policies (fail fast).
4.1) Compute policy_hash and roster_hash (if replicas.toml exists) and store in StoreRuntime.
5) Open WAL and SQLite index; rebuild index if needed.
6) Verify filesystem WAL segments before serving traffic (normative):
   - For every wal/<namespace>/segment-*.wal file, read the segment header and verify:
     - store_id/store_epoch match StoreMeta,
     - namespace in header matches directory,
     - wal_format_version supported.
   - On mismatch, fail fast with an operator-facing remediation (archive or delete).
7) Recover baseline state (normative, deterministic):
   - Preferred: import latest verified local checkpoint cache for each group (if present).
     If cache meta.json policy_hash/roster_hash mismatch local, surface warning before serving writes.
   - Else: import latest Git checkpoint heads for configured groups (if available).
   - Else: migration import (legacy git ref / legacy snapshot WAL) into namespace "core".
   - Else: start empty.
   - Merge multiple imported baselines deterministically via CRDT join per namespace.
   - Initialize applied+durable watermarks to the merged max(meta.included) for each
     imported namespace/origin.
8) Replay WAL to reach "now" (normative):
   - For each namespace, scan/index segments as needed, then apply only events with
     origin_seq > baseline watermark (per origin) in contiguous order.
   - Advance applied and durable watermarks as events are applied and fsync-confirmed.
9) Start IPC server, replication listener, replication manager, checkpoint scheduler.

### 7.4 Identity discovery and repo binding

Replace or augment current resolve_remote():
- Primary: fetch refs/beads/meta and read store_meta.json.
- Fallback: list refs/beads/<store_id>/*.
- Migration-only fallback: UUIDv5(normalized_remote_url).
- Persist mapping path -> StoreId; do not rekey on URL changes.

### 7.5 EventBroadcaster and hot-cache (recommended)

Define EventBroadcaster as BOTH:
1) a bounded pub/sub mechanism for new events, and
2) a bounded in-memory hot-cache of canonical EventBody bytes.

Requirements:
- On successful WAL append (local or remote), StoreRuntime MUST publish:
  - EventId, sha, prev_sha, namespace, and canonical EventBody bytes (Bytes).
- The broadcaster MUST enforce backpressure:
  - bounded channels (by bytes/events),
  - slow subscribers MAY be dropped with ERROR(code="subscriber_lagged").
- Hot-cache eviction MUST be deterministic and bounded:
  - eviction by total bytes and/or total events (FIFO is sufficient).

Replication fast-path:
- Outbound replication sessions SHOULD subscribe to the broadcaster.
- If a peer is caught up (or within cache retention), the sender SHOULD stream events
  directly from hot-cache without reading WAL segments.
- If a peer falls behind beyond cache retention, the sender MUST fall back to WAL index
  + segment reads via stream_range_bytes.

Subscribe IPC fast-path:
- Subscribe SHOULD stream from broadcaster; historical backfill uses WAL reads gated by
  require_min_seen and bounded by MAX_EVENT_BATCH_BYTES.

---

## 8) Mutation pipeline refactor (events-first)

Add a MutationEngine to transform ops into events.

### 8.1 Mutation planning

MutationEngine responsibilities:
- Validate inputs and CAS conditions.
- Determine effective ActorId:
  - request.actor_id if present (and permitted by IPC policy),
  - else daemon default actor id.
- Mint txn_id and stamps using daemon clock.
- Mint stamps using per-ActorId HLC state and populate EventBody.hlc_max.
- Build exactly one EventBody (kind=TxnV1) per client mutation request.
  If the request would exceed MAX_WAL_RECORD_BYTES, return an explicit error
  instructing the client to split the operation into multiple requests.
- Enforce content-level limits before encoding:
  - reject note_appends with content > MAX_NOTE_BYTES,
  - reject txns with total ops > MAX_OPS_PER_TXN,
  - enforce per-bead label count and other bounded fields.
- Validate dep ops (local-only):
  - require from/to beads exist,
  - enforce DAG for Blocks/Parent (reject cycles),
  - reject cross-namespace deps.
- Support client_request_id idempotency.

### 8.2 Event sequencing and idempotency

- origin_seq allocated at WAL append, not in memory.
- If client_request_id exists in WAL index, return a reconstructed prior receipt without new events.
- MutationEngine MUST compute request_sha256 from a canonicalized mutation request representation
  (retry-stable; excludes durability wait targets and wait_timeout_ms) and pass it to WAL append so it is persisted in:
  - SQLite client_requests.request_sha256
  - WAL record header (has_request_sha256)

### 8.3 Apply pipeline (ordered steps)

1) Validate input and namespace policy.
2) Idempotency check (client_request_id).
3) Build one event draft (no seq, no hash).
4) WAL append + fsync (per durability class).
5) Apply events to state via core::apply_event.
6) Update query indexes and in-memory derived indexes.
7) Notify subscribers (if enabled).
8) Trigger replication and checkpoint scheduling.

Note: dep_delete remains idempotent in the event path. Any strict "dep_not_found"
behavior is a CLI/planner preflight only and MUST NOT be enforced during replay
or replication.

### 8.4 Write stamp generation (explicit)

Write stamps are minted from HLC clock:
- monotonic per actor
- total order: (physical_ms, logical_counter, actor_id)

event_time_ms MUST equal physical wall time used to mint the stamp.

HLC persistence integration:
- When a mutation is appended (LocalFsync boundary), persist updated HLC state
  in the same critical section as WAL append/index commit.

---

## 9) Replication subsystem (`src/daemon/repl/*`)

Replication uses framed CBOR messages (same framing as WAL).

### 9.1 Modules

- frame.rs: length + crc32c framing (shared with WAL format)
- proto.rs: typed message schemas (HELLO, WELCOME, EVENTS, ACK, WANT, ERROR)
- session.rs: per-connection state machine
- manager.rs: outbound peers, reconnect/backoff, event fanout
- server.rs: listener and accept loop
- snapshot.rs: deferred in v0.5 (snapshot bootstrap reintroduced later)

### 9.2 Message envelope

CBOR map `{ v, type, body }` with `minicbor`.
Event payloads SHOULD embed canonical EventBody bytes (see EventBytes/EventFrameV1);
sha256/prev_sha256 live in the frame header, not inside the payload.
Decoding into EventBody structs is required only for apply and validation.
Hash verification remains mandatory.

### 9.3 Handshake and protocol negotiation

HELLO body:
- protocol_version
- min_protocol_version
- store_id
- store_epoch
- sender_replica_id
- hello_nonce
- max_frame_bytes (sender limit)
- requested_namespaces
- offered_namespaces
- seen_durable (per requested namespace)  // contiguous durable watermark map
- seen_durable_heads? (per requested namespace) // sha256 at seen_durable for origins present
- seen_applied? (per requested namespace) // optional; helps peers reason about read lag
- seen_applied_heads? (per requested namespace) // sha256 at seen_applied (optional)
- capabilities (supports_snapshots (v0.5: false), supports_live_stream, supports_compression)

WELCOME body:
- protocol_version (negotiated)
- store_id
- store_epoch
- receiver_replica_id
- welcome_nonce
- accepted_namespaces
- receiver_seen_durable (per accepted namespace)
- receiver_seen_durable_heads? (per accepted namespace)
- receiver_seen_applied? (per accepted namespace)
- receiver_seen_applied_heads? (per accepted namespace)
- live_stream_enabled
- max_frame_bytes (effective limit)

Version negotiation:
- negotiated version v = min(max_a, max_b) if v >= max(min_a, min_b); else incompatible.
- effective frame limit = min(sender.max_frame_bytes, receiver.max_frame_bytes).

### 9.4 EVENTS

Body:
- events: [EventFrameV1]

EventFrameV1:
- eid: EventId
- sha256: bytes(32)
- prev_sha256?: bytes(32)  (omitted for seq==1)
- bytes: bytes  (canonical CBOR EventBody bytes, excluding sha256/prev_sha256)

Rules:
- Sender MAY batch.
- Sender MUST send events for a given (namespace, origin_replica_id) in strictly
  increasing origin_seq order.
- Receiver MUST validate:
  - store_id/store_epoch match
  - EventId fields (namespace/origin_replica_id/origin_seq) match the decoded EventBody
  - bytes decode as EventBody within bounds (3.4) and sha256(bytes) matches frame sha256
  - if event_id already exists, sha256 matches prior observed sha256
  - prev_sha256 validation:
    - if origin_seq == durable_seen + 1 (contiguous), prev_sha256 MUST match the
      receiver's current head sha for that (namespace, origin_replica_id) before append/apply
      (seq==1 => prev_sha256 omitted).
    - if origin_seq > durable_seen + 1, receiver MAY buffer even if prev_sha256
      cannot be validated yet; if the predecessor hash is already known (durable or
      buffered seq-1), receiver SHOULD validate early and treat mismatch as corruption.
- Receiver applies idempotently, buffers gaps, and advances seen_map only when
  contiguous.

Ingestion ordering rule (clarified, normative):
- Receiver MUST NOT append to WAL unless the event is contiguous for that
  (namespace, origin_replica_id): origin_seq == durable_seen + 1.
- If origin_seq > durable_seen + 1, receiver MUST buffer (bounded) and issue WANT.
- Buffered events MUST NOT be appended until they become contiguous and prev_sha256
  continuity is verified; when draining a buffered suffix, validate prev_sha256
  against the newly advanced head for each event.
- Remote ingest MUST call EventWal::ingest_remote_bytes (not append_local) so
  origin_seq is preserved and canonical bytes are persisted unchanged.

### 9.5 ACK

Body:
- durable: { namespace -> { origin_replica_id -> u64 } }
- durable_heads?: { namespace -> { origin_replica_id -> bytes(32) } }
- applied?: { namespace -> { origin_replica_id -> u64 } }
- applied_heads?: { namespace -> { origin_replica_id -> bytes(32) } }

Rules:
- durable advances only after WAL fsync; checkpoint import may advance durable watermarks for bootstrap.
- applied advances only after apply_event.
- Both vectors monotonic per (namespace, origin).
- ACKs may be standalone or piggybacked.

Head-hash rule (normative):
- If an ACK includes durable_heads/applied_heads for an origin, the sha MUST be the
  hash at the corresponding seq value in the same ACK message.
- If a peer reports the same seq but a different head sha for a (namespace, origin),
  this indicates divergence/corruption. The receiver MUST:
  - stop streaming EVENTS for that origin,
  - close with ERROR(code="diverged") or ERROR(code="bootstrap_required").

### 9.6 WANT

Body:
- want: { namespace -> { origin_replica_id -> u64 } } meaning "send seq > this"

Rules:
- Respond with EVENTS until satisfied.
- Must use WAL index to avoid O(total WAL) scans.
If WAL cannot serve the requested range, the sender MUST respond with an explicit error
in v0.5:

- ERROR(code="bootstrap_required", retryable=false)

Reason: v0.5 defers replication snapshot bootstrap. The receiver is expected to bootstrap
from a checkpoint (Git checkpoint lane or local checkpoint cache) and then retry replication.
The ERROR details SHOULD include namespaces and best-known included watermarks when available.

### 9.7 (Deferred in v0.5) Snapshot messages

Deferred in v0.5. Snapshot bootstrap over replication is reintroduced only after:
- WAL pruning exists (so ranges can truly be missing),
- checkpoint cache import/export is battle-tested,
- resource accounting and resume semantics are implemented and tested.

### 9.8 Gap handling and flow control

Gap handling:
- seen_durable_map tracks highest contiguous durable seq per (namespace, origin).
- If origin_seq > seen_durable_map + 1, buffer and request WANT.
- Gap buffer MUST be bounded (defaults: 10k events or 10 MiB per connection).
- If bounds exceeded or gaps do not resolve in time, drop and re-handshake.

Flow control:
- Sender must bound in-flight events (max 10k or 10 MiB).
- ACKs advance sender windows.
- Keep fairness across namespaces to avoid starvation.

Fair scheduling (normative defaults):
- Add bounds:
  - MAX_EVENTS_PER_ORIGIN_PER_BATCH default 1024
  - MAX_BYTES_PER_ORIGIN_PER_BATCH default 1 MiB
- Sender MUST construct each EVENTS batch by round-robin over eligible (namespace, origin_replica_id)
  pairs, respecting per-origin caps, so that a single hot origin cannot starve others.

Rate limiting (normative):
- Receiver MUST enforce MAX_REPL_INGEST_BYTES_PER_SEC if configured, and apply backpressure by
  stopping reads or responding ERROR(code="overloaded") and closing the connection.

Keepalive:
- Send PING if no traffic for KEEPALIVE_MS.
- Drop connection after DEAD_MS of silence.

PING/PONG:
- PING body: nonce
- PONG body: nonce

Compression safety (normative):
- If supports_compression is enabled (e.g., zstd), every compressed frame MUST
  carry its uncompressed_length, and the receiver MUST enforce:
  - uncompressed_length <= MAX_FRAME_BYTES
  - cumulative uncompressed bytes per batch <= MAX_EVENT_BATCH_BYTES
  Reject frames that violate bounds before allocating full buffers.

### 9.9 Replication scope and policies

Replicate only namespaces where policy requires it:
- replicate=none: no send/receive
- replicate=anchors: only anchors
- replicate=peers: connected peers
- replicate=p2p: discovered peers (transport only; correctness unchanged)

### 9.10 Error handling (explicit)

- Store id mismatch: close connection with ERROR(code="wrong_store").
- Store epoch mismatch: reject and require checkpoint bootstrap; do not merge state.
- Equivocation: same EventId with different sha is protocol corruption; terminate session.

Error payload and retry metadata (normative):
- All error codes MUST be defined in REALTIME_ERRORS.md.
- ERROR frames MUST set retryable=true only when the peer can retry safely without
  human intervention (e.g., overloaded, temporary network).
- For retryable errors, ERROR SHOULD include retry_after_ms to avoid thundering herds.

---

## 10) Durability coordination

Add a DurabilityCoordinator to track pending txns and completion conditions.

### 10.1 Durability classes

- LocalFsync: complete after WAL fsync + apply.
- ReplicatedFsync(k): wait for durable ACKs from k eligible replicas.

### 10.2 Replica selection for k

- replicate=anchors: choose anchors
- replicate=peers: choose connected peers
- replicate=none: ReplicatedFsync invalid (fail fast)

Fail-fast availability (normative):
- If requested ReplicatedFsync(k) and the eligible configured replica set size < k,
  return ERROR(code="durability_unavailable") immediately (do not wait).
- If eligible set size >= k but fewer than k are currently connected, the daemon MAY wait
  up to timeout and then return retryable timeout with receipt.

### 10.3 Container rule (client mode)

Ephemeral containers:
- Must submit mutations to durable replica.
- Must not be counted as durable copies.

### 10.4 Git checkpoints in v0.5

Git checkpoints exist in v0.5 as a deterministic checkpoint lane for bootstrap and
recovery. v0.5 does not support "wait until checkpointed" as a durability class.
Checkpoint status is exposed via admin.status and checkpoint cache metadata.

### 10.5 Receipt and retry semantics

- On success: return DurabilityReceipt.
- On timeout: return retryable error including receipt.
- require_min_seen for reads and subscriptions MUST compare against applied watermarks.

---

## 11) Local subscriptions (IPC streaming)

Add Subscribe IPC request:
- streams EventBody objects (canonical bytes optional) plus header sha/prev metadata
- supports require_min_seen (wait or return retryable error)
- separate from materialized query responses (views remain the query path)

---

## 12) (Deferred in v0.5) Snapshot bootstrap (realtime)

Deferred in v0.5. Bootstrap uses checkpoints (Git lane or local cache).

---

## 13) Git lane becomes checkpoint lane (`src/git/checkpoint/*`)

### 13.1 New checkpoint modules

Add `src/git/checkpoint/`:
- layout.rs: sharded JSONL layout for state/tombstones/deps per namespace
- manifest.rs: deterministic file list and hashes
- meta.rs: checkpoint meta (included watermarks, content hash, manifest hash)
- export.rs: build checkpoint tree from StoreState
- import.rs: parse, verify, and merge into StoreState

### 13.2 Git refs

- Discovery ref: `refs/beads/meta` (contains store_meta.json)
- Checkpoint refs: `refs/beads/<store_id>/<group>`
- Legacy ref: `refs/heads/beads/store` (read-only during migration)

### 13.3 Checkpoint content format (normative)

Each checkpoint commit tree contains:
- meta.json (checkpoint metadata)
- manifest.json (deterministic list + hashes)
- namespaces/<ns>/state/<shard>.jsonl
- namespaces/<ns>/tombstones/<shard>.jsonl
- namespaces/<ns>/deps/<shard>.jsonl

Sharding rule:
- 256 shards `00.jsonl` .. `ff.jsonl` under each directory.
- Missing shards are empty.
- Shard assignment:
  - beads: first byte of sha256(id_bytes)
  - tombstones: first byte of sha256(id_bytes)
  - deps: first byte of sha256(dep_key_bytes) where dep_key_bytes = from "\0" to "\0" kind
- Within each shard, JSONL lines sorted by key:
  - beads by id
  - tombstones by id
  - deps by (from,to,kind)

JSON encoding requirements:
- UTF-8
- stable key ordering for objects (canonical JSON, see below)
- no extra whitespace
- each JSONL line ends with "\n"

Canonical JSON (normative):
- All JSON objects MUST be serialized with keys sorted by UTF-8 byte order ascending,
  recursively for nested objects.
- Writers MUST NOT rely on HashMap iteration order at any layer.
- Introduce a shared helper used by checkpoint export and manifest/meta writers:
  - `src/core/json_canon.rs` (or `src/git/checkpoint/json_canon.rs`)
  - API sketch: `fn to_canon_json_bytes<T: Serialize>(v: &T) -> Vec<u8>`
- Canonical JSON MUST emit:
  - no insignificant whitespace,
  - deterministic escaping as per serde_json,
  - no NaN/Infinity floats (reject if encountered).

### 13.4 manifest.json (normative)

manifest.json fields:
- checkpoint_group
- store_id
- store_epoch
- namespaces (sorted)
- files: { "<path>": { "sha256": "<sha256-hex>", "bytes": <u64> } }
  for each file present excluding meta.json and manifest.json

Missing shards are treated as empty and therefore do not appear in files.
manifest_hash MUST be computed over canonical JSON bytes (not "pretty" JSON).

### 13.5 meta.json (required fields)

meta.json fields:
- checkpoint_format_version
- store_id
- store_epoch
- checkpoint_group
- namespaces (included)
- created_at_ms
- created_by_replica_id
- policy_hash  // sha256 over canonical policy representation (namespaces.toml after validation)
- roster_hash? // sha256 over canonical replicas.toml if present (else omitted)
- included: { namespace -> { origin_replica_id -> u64 } }
- included_heads?: { namespace -> { origin_replica_id -> sha256_hex } }
  // Optional in v0.5. Becomes required once WAL pruning is enabled.
- content_hash (sha256 of canonical meta preimage bytes; see algorithm below)
- manifest_hash (sha256 of manifest.json bytes)

content_hash algorithm (non-recursive, normative):
1) Write all shard files. Compute each file's sha256 and byte length.
2) Write manifest.json (Canonical JSON) and compute:
   manifest_hash = sha256(manifest.json bytes) in lowercase hex.
3) Build a meta preimage object equal to meta.json but with `content_hash` omitted.
4) Serialize the meta preimage using Canonical JSON.
5) content_hash = sha256(meta_preimage_bytes) in lowercase hex.

Import rule:
- Recompute manifest_hash; verify each file hash (and optionally size) listed in manifest.
- Recompute content_hash from the meta preimage; reject if mismatch.
- If local policy_hash differs from checkpoint policy_hash, daemon MUST emit a warning
  and SHOULD surface it in admin.status/admin.doctor. Strict mode MAY reject import.
- If roster_hash is present and differs, daemon MUST emit a warning (durability semantics may differ).

### 13.6 Checkpoint writer selection

Each group defines:
- checkpoint_writers (replica_id list)
- primary_checkpoint_writer

Only primary writer must auto-push.
Other writers may push only on override or failover configuration.

### 13.7 Checkpoint scheduling (normative defaults)

Each group has:
- debounce_ms default 200
- max_interval_ms default 1000
- max_events default 2000

Rules:
- When an event is applied in any included namespace, group becomes dirty.
- Dirty groups schedule a checkpoint:
  - after debounce_ms since last event, or
  - when max_interval_ms since first dirtied elapses, or
  - when max_events new events included
- Only one checkpoint push in flight per group. If new events arrive during push,
  they are included in the next scheduled checkpoint.

### 13.8 Export algorithm (normative)

1) Materialize converged state for included namespaces.
2) Incremental export (normative):
   - Track dirty shards per namespace in StoreRuntime using ApplyOutcome.
   - Regenerate only dirty shard files since the last exported checkpoint for the group.
   - Reuse previous checkpoint blobs for unchanged shard paths.
   - Determinism rule remains: regenerated shard JSONL lines MUST be sorted as specified.
3) Checkpoint snapshot barrier (normative):
   - The coordinator thread MUST capture:
     - included watermarks (durable) for the group
     - a consistent view of the shard contents to be written (full or dirty-only)
   - This captured payload (CheckpointSnapshot) MUST be immutable and handed to a
     checkpoint worker thread for file I/O, hashing, commit creation, and push.
   - The snapshot MUST NOT claim inclusion of watermarks that are not represented
     by the shard contents in that snapshot.
4) Write manifest.json.
5) Write meta.json including included watermarks (durable), manifest_hash, content_hash.
6) Create commit on group ref.
7) Push.
8) Cache the exported checkpoint locally (recommended, operational):
   - Store a verified copy (or hardlinks) under the store dir cache path.
   - Keep only the last N checkpoints per group (default N=3), prune older caches
     after successful newer writes.
   - Cache publish MUST be atomic:
     - write into `checkpoint_cache/<group>/.tmp/<checkpoint_id>/`
     - fsync files, then rename to `checkpoint_cache/<group>/<checkpoint_id>/`
     - write `<checkpoint_id>.tar.zst` as `<checkpoint_id>.tar.zst.tmp` then rename
     - fsync `checkpoint_cache/<group>/` directory after publishes
     - update `checkpoint_cache/<group>/CURRENT` (write tmp + rename) to point to the
       newest verified checkpoint_id
9) (Deferred in v0.5) Snapshot artifact:
   - Snapshot tar/zstd export is deferred with replication snapshot bootstrap.

### 13.9 Import / merge algorithm (normative)

1) Fetch remote head for each checkpoint group.
2) Parse checkpoint tree (cached or fetched).
3) Verify manifest_hash and content_hash; reject if mismatch.
3.1) If included_heads is present, StoreRuntime MAY seed head_sha from it.
     v0.5 does not require included_heads because WAL pruning is deferred.
4) Merge into local state deterministically.
5) Advance durable watermarks to at least meta.included for included namespaces.
6) If local state changed and replica is checkpoint writer, export new checkpoint.

### 13.9.1 Import hardening (normative, deferred for snapshots in v0.5)

Snapshot tar extraction safety applies to replication snapshot bootstrap, which is
deferred in v0.5. Checkpoint import still uses the same safety principles when
reading cached checkpoint trees from disk.

Snapshot tar extraction safety:
- MUST enforce MAX_SNAPSHOT_BYTES on total extracted bytes (not just archive size).
- MUST enforce MAX_SNAPSHOT_ENTRIES (default 200,000) on entry count.
- MUST enforce MAX_SNAPSHOT_ENTRY_BYTES (default 64 MiB) per entry.
- MUST reject entries with path traversal (../) or absolute paths.
- MUST reject symlinks (do not follow; reject archive).
- MUST reject device files, fifos, or other non-regular files.
- MUST extract to temp directory first, then validate manifest/hashes before moving.

JSONL shard parsing safety:
- MUST use streaming JSONL parser (line-by-line, not full-file buffer).
- MUST enforce MAX_JSONL_LINE_BYTES (default 4 MiB) per line.
- MUST enforce MAX_JSONL_SHARD_BYTES (default 256 MiB) per shard file.
- MUST reject lines that are not valid UTF-8 or valid JSON.
- MUST reject JSON objects exceeding schema-expected nesting depth (default 32).
- MUST count and bound total entities per shard (implicit via MAX_SNAPSHOT_ENTRIES overall).

Validation sequence:
1) Extract to temp dir with all safety checks above.
2) Verify manifest_hash over extracted manifest.json bytes.
3) Verify each file hash in manifest.
4) Verify content_hash over entire tree.
5) Parse and validate each JSONL shard within limits.
6) Only then move/merge into store state.

### 13.10 Multi-writer safety

If push fails (non-FF):
1) fetch latest head
2) import + merge
3) re-export new checkpoint commit
4) retry push with bounded attempts/backoff

Correctness must not depend on a single writer, even if recommended.

---

## 14) Scheduler integration

Add a checkpoint scheduler:
- Debounce after local mutations.
- Max interval and max events per spec.
- One in-flight push per checkpoint group.
- Heavy checkpoint work (export, hash, commit, push) SHOULD run in a dedicated
  worker thread. The coordinator owns the snapshot barrier and only submits
  immutable jobs, so mutation/replication latency remains stable.

Separate replication reconnect/backoff logic from checkpoint scheduling.

## 15) Config and path layout

### 15.1 Store directory layout

```
$BD_DATA_DIR/stores/<store_id>/
  meta.json
  namespaces.toml
  replicas.toml
  wal/<namespace>/*.wal
  index/wal.sqlite
  snap/  # reserved for snapshot bootstrap (deferred in v0.5)
  checkpoint_cache/<group>/<checkpoint_id>/
  checkpoint_cache/<group>/<checkpoint_id>.tar.zst
  checkpoint_cache/<group>/CURRENT
```

Update `src/paths.rs`:
- add helpers for stores_dir(), store_dir(store_id), store_meta_path(store_id)
- maintain BD_DATA_DIR override

Filesystem safety rules (new, normative):
- Store directories MUST be created with mode 0700 (or platform equivalent).
- Sensitive files (meta.json, replicas.toml, namespaces.toml, wal.sqlite, PSK material) MUST be 0600.
- When opening critical paths, daemon MUST reject symlinks:
  - meta.json
  - index/wal.sqlite
  - wal/<namespace>/
  This prevents writing outside store_dir via symlink attacks/misconfig.

### 15.2 Config additions

Add configuration for:
- replica_id stability and store identity persistence
- namespace policy defaults
- checkpoint groups
- replication peers, listen address, max frame size, timeouts

---

## 16) IPC, API, and CLI changes

### 16.1 IPC (`src/daemon/ipc.rs`)

Add to all mutation requests:
- namespace (optional, default "core")
- durability (optional, default LocalFsync; v0.5 supports LocalFsync and ReplicatedFsync(k) only)
- client_request_id (optional UUID)
- actor_id (optional, default daemon actor; used for stamps and attribution)

Response changes:
- include DurabilityReceipt on success
- on timeout waiting for remote durability, return retryable error including receipt

Error response shape (normative):
- All IPC errors MUST use ErrorPayload as defined in 0.14 and REALTIME_ERRORS.md.
- Mutation timeout waiting for stronger durability MUST return:
  - code="durability_timeout"
  - retryable=true
  - receipt present (so client can retry idempotently)

IPC_PROTOCOL_VERSION bump only when adding streaming responses.

Add to all read/query requests (normative):
- require_min_seen: Option<WatermarkMap>  // applied watermark gating for read-your-writes
- wait_timeout_ms: Option<u64>            // bounded wait; default small; 0 = no wait

Read gating semantics (normative):
- If require_min_seen is not satisfied:
  - the daemon MAY wait up to wait_timeout_ms for apply to catch up, else
  - return a retryable error including current applied watermarks.

Add admin/introspection ops:
- `admin.status`: returns store_id, replica_id, namespaces, applied/durable watermarks,
  WAL segment stats (count/bytes), index health (last_indexed_offset per segment),
  replication sessions (peers, last_ack, lag), checkpoint groups (dirty/in-flight/last push).
- `admin.flush`: forces fsync for a namespace (and optionally triggers checkpoint now).
- `admin.rebuild_index`: rebuilds SQLite index from WAL (explicit operator action).
- `admin.metrics`: returns a simple text or JSON snapshot of key counters and
  latencies (append/fsync p50/p95, queue depths, replication lag per peer/ns,
  checkpoint durations, GC sweep stats).
- `admin.verify_store`: runs offline-ish verification checks (segment headers match
  meta, content_hash recompute for last checkpoint, index vs WAL spot checks).
- `admin.scrub_now`: performs a bounded integrity scrub while the daemon is live:
  - samples up to N events per namespace (default N=200, configurable),
  - verifies WAL CRC32c and sha256 (preimage) correctness,
  - verifies SQLite offsets point to valid record_magic and header_len,
  - optionally verifies the newest checkpoint_cache entries (manifest_hash + content_hash).
  Returns structured pass/warn/fail results similar to admin.doctor.
- `admin.doctor`: runs a bounded health scrub and returns a deterministic report:
  - machine-readable JSON with:
    - checks: [{ id, status, severity, evidence, suggested_actions }]
    - summary: { risk: low|medium|high|critical,
                 safe_to_accept_writes: bool,
                 safe_to_prune_wal: bool,
                 safe_to_rebuild_index: bool }
  - MUST include explicit remediation actions (exact admin ops to run, in order).
- `admin.gc_now`: deferred in v0.5 (retention enforcement via GC markers is deferred).
- `admin.prune_wal`: deferred in v0.5 (WAL pruning is deferred).
- `admin.maintenance_mode`: toggles maintenance/read-only mode:
  - when enabled: reject new mutations/replication ingest with ERROR(code="maintenance_mode"),
    but allow admin/read operations.
  - required for any online repair actions beyond tail truncation.
- `admin.reload_policies`: reloads namespaces.toml, validates, applies safe live changes,
  and returns a diff summary (applied vs requires_restart).
- `admin.rotate_replica_id`: generates a new replica_id, updates meta.json, logs the
  old -> new mapping. Used for recovery from duplicated store directories.
- `admin.fingerprint`: returns stable convergence fingerprints:
  - per-namespace: { namespace -> { state_sha256, tombstones_sha256, deps_sha256, namespace_root } }
  - includes watermarks_applied and watermarks_durable used as the basis
  - supports modes:
    - full (may be expensive; includes per-shard hashes)
    - sample(N) (bounded; good for periodic monitoring)
  Intended use: quickly detect divergence across replicas and validate repairs.

Fingerprint algorithm (normative; Merkle-ish, shard-based):
- For each namespace and each type in fixed order: [state, tombstones, deps]:
  - define shard_hash[00..ff] where shard_hash[i] is sha256 of the canonical JSONL bytes
    for that shard file, and empty shards use sha256 of empty bytes.
  - define type_root = sha256( concat( i_byte || shard_hash[i]_bytes ) for i=0..255 ).
- Define namespace_root = sha256( concat( type_root_state || type_root_tombstones || type_root_deps ) ).
- `admin.fingerprint` MUST return:
  - namespace_root (and type_roots) in all modes,
  - per-shard hashes in "full" mode (bounded by response size),
  - `sample(N)` returns N deterministically sampled shard indices plus their hashes.
    Sampling uses sha256(namespace || request_nonce) to select indices, so different
    calls sample different shards.

Operational win:
- This allows pinpointing divergence ("deps shard 7f differs") and enables targeted repair tooling.

Observability requirements (normative):
- Every mutation MUST be traceable end-to-end via txn_id and (if present) client_request_id.
- Replication sessions MUST log peer identity (replica_id + authenticated identity) and
  namespace authorization decisions.
- Emit at minimum:
  - counters: wal_append_ok/err, wal_fsync_ok/err, apply_ok/err, repl_events_in/out,
    checkpoint_export_ok/err, scrub_ok/err, scrub_records_checked
  - gauges: IPC inflight, repl ingest queue bytes/events, checkpoint job queue depth,
    per-peer lag (durable watermark diff), wal_bytes_total, wal_segments_total,
    wal_growth_bytes_per_sec, wal_growth_segments_per_sec (per namespace, windowed)
  - histograms: wal_append_duration, wal_fsync_duration, apply_duration, checkpoint_duration

Graceful shutdown (normative):
- On SIGTERM / shutdown request: stop accepting new mutation requests, drain in-flight
  durability waits (bounded), flush WAL, close segments, then exit.

### 16.2 API (`src/api/mod.rs`)

Expose:
- namespace in issue summaries and issue views
- durability receipt types in JSON mode
- replication status fields (watermarks, warnings)

### 16.3 CLI

Add global:
- --namespace

Add mutation flags:
- --durability
- --client-request-id

Update handlers to pass through IPC.

## 17) Migration strategy

### 17.1 Legacy WAL snapshot

- Rename old wal.rs to wal_legacy_snapshot.
- On store open during migration:
  - read legacy snapshot WAL (if present)
  - merge into StoreState["core"]
  - proceed with new event WAL thereafter

### 17.2 Legacy Git ref

- Import refs/heads/beads/store into StoreState["core"].
- Export first checkpoint to new ref.
- Mirror legacy ref for one release if needed.
- Keep legacy wire format reader for migration only.

### 17.3 Identity migration

- Prefer refs/beads/meta for store identity.
- Only fall back to URL-derived identity as migration bootstrap.
- Persist store_id and replica_id locally; do not re-derive if remote URL changes.

Initial watermarks:
- After baseline import, set applied and durable to included watermarks
  for origins represented in baseline.

---

## 18) Testing and validation

Add deterministic tests for:
- Canonical CBOR EventBody hashing stability (bytes identical across runs)
- WAL framing and tail truncation
- WAL index rebuild from segments
- origin_seq allocation and idempotency mapping/receipts
- apply idempotence and note collision detection
- dep_upsert/dep_delete CBOR encode/decode and delete-before-create convergence
- dep_delete idempotence across replay
- DAG enforcement for Blocks/Parent in mutation planning
- replication ACK/WANT behavior and backpressure
- checkpoint export/import determinism, manifest and content hashes
- store discovery order and identity persistence
- store-global lock enforcement
- admin.status correctness under load (watermarks/segment stats are consistent)
- graceful shutdown does not lose locally durable events
- fingerprint determinism (same state -> same sha256 across runs/platforms)

Add performance benchmarks (recommended, prevents regressions):
- WAL append throughput and tail latency under:
  - fsync per record
  - group commit (vary max latency/events/bytes)
- WAL index rebuild time vs WAL size (GiB scale)
- Replication WANT servicing latency under concurrent writes
- Checkpoint export wall time and CPU usage vs state size (beads/deps/notes)

Add rolling-upgrade compatibility tests (recommended):
- WAL replay compatibility across wal_format_version N-1 -> N
- checkpoint import compatibility across checkpoint_format_version N-1 -> N
- replication protocol negotiation matrix:
  - min/max protocol versions
  - capability mismatches (compression; snapshots deferred in v0.5)

Upgrade/rollback policy (normative):
- WAL format changes MUST support reading N-1 records during transition.
- Rollback is safe if no new-format records have been written:
  - Check wal_format_version in meta.json before downgrade.
  - If current WAL contains only N-1 compatible records, rollback is allowed.
  - If any N-only records exist, rollback requires WAL truncation or checkpoint restore.
- Checkpoint format N MUST import N-1 checkpoints without data loss.
- Replication peers negotiate min(max_version) >= max(min_version); incompatible peers
  disconnect cleanly with ERROR(code="version_incompatible").
- Document upgrade sequence in release notes: stop daemon, upgrade binary, start daemon.
  Rolling upgrades (mixed-version cluster) are supported if all versions share
  overlapping protocol_version ranges.

Add fuzzing + crash safety validation (recommended):
- cargo-fuzz targets:
  - WAL frame decode (length/crc/tail truncation)
  - CBOR EventBody decode with bounds (depth, map entries, array entries)
  - replication message decode (HELLO/WELCOME/EVENTS)
- crash tests (integration):
  - inject SIGKILL during append (after write before fsync, after fsync before index commit, etc)
  - assert recovery behavior: no duplicate origin_seq, tail truncation correct, index rebuild correct

Add offline fsck tests (recommended):
- golden corpus tests for `bd store fsck` output stability
- fixtures that include:
  - tail truncation cases
  - mid-file corruption cases (must require offline mode to repair)
  - quarantine + rebuild index workflows

---

## 19) Recommended phase ordering

1) Core types + StoreState + receipts
2) Canonical CBOR + EventBody + apply path
3) Event WAL + SQLite index + replay
4) Mutation engine (events-first)
5) Replication subsystem + ACK semantics
6) Git checkpoint lane
7) IPC streaming subscriptions (snapshot bootstrap deferred)

This ordering minimizes scope collapse and keeps the system operable as each layer lands.

## Deferred: Authenticated replication (next phase)

Authenticated replication (ed25519 handshake signatures, replica roster authorization) is explicitly deferred to the next phase. The current plan assumes a trusted network boundary (tailnet). Auth will be added after the distributed database correctness is validated.

# Tests: Collapsing the Remaining Space

Types decide what states you can even talk about.  
Traits decide what capabilities can exist.  
Errors decide how those capabilities can refuse.

**Tests decide which implementations of that story we will actually allow to exist.**

Types/traits/errors still leave you with an enormous space of possible programs that are “technically valid.”  
A test suite’s job is simple:

> **Collapse that remaining space until only a handful of implementations survive, ideally one.**

No more, no less.

## 0. Forcing functions

Keep these four rules in your head whenever you write or review a test.

1. **Every test must kill a family of wrong implementations.**  
   If you can’t point at a *non‑contrived* implementation that:
   - passes all existing tests,  
   - fails *this* one,
   - and would be bad in production,  
   then the test is noise.

2. **Tests are executable attempts to falsify claims.**  
   A test is always of the form:

   > “Under this model of the world, for these inputs, this relation between before/after must hold.”

   No claim → no test.

3. **Assert each fact at the lowest level where it can be expressed cleanly.**  
   If something can be stated and checked:
   - on a pure function instead of an HTTP endpoint,  
   - on a trait implementation instead of a full system,  
   do it there.  
   E2E is the last place a fact should appear, not the first.

4. **A test that doesn’t change a decision surface is decoration.**  
   If this behavior regressed, what concrete decision would change?  
   - An HTTP code?  
   - A retry vs no‑retry?  
   - A permission check?  
   - A money move?  
   If you can’t answer, delete or rewrite the test.

---

## 1. What a test is (in our universe)

We treat each test as:

- a **claim** – a sentence you could write in English,
- a **search space** – which inputs / worlds it actually explores,
- an **oracle** – a predicate that says “the claim held here.”

Mechanically:

```text
Claim:     decode(encode(x)) == x  for all valid x
Space:     100 random x + a few hand-picked edge cases
Oracle:    assert_eq!(decode(encode(x)), x)
````

If you can’t name all three, you don’t understand the test yet.

---

## 2. The only shapes of tests we use

To shrink the design space, we pretend there are only four kinds of tests.
Every test must be exactly one of these:

1. **Law tests (`∀`)**

   * “For all valid inputs, property P holds.”
   * Usually property‑based or small, carefully‑chosen sets of examples.
   * Lives at the level of types and traits.
   * Examples:

     * once `Iterator::next` returns `None`, it never returns `Some`;
     * scoring is monotone in some dimension;
     * decode(encode(x)) = x.

2. **Example tests (`∃`, canonical)**

   * “For this specific, meaningful input, this output / error happens.”
   * These are the examples you’d put in docs.
   * Good for weird business rules, boundary cases, and explaining semantics.

3. **Scenario tests (protocol/flow)**

   * “Given this starting state and this series of actions, these observable outcomes happen.”
   * Cross‑component behavior: HTTP → app → DB, queues, etc.
   * Focused on externally visible behavior and contracts.

4. **Regression tests (fossilized bug)**

   * “This *exact* combination of inputs and world used to break. Never again.”
   * Named after incidents / tickets when possible.
   * Ideally get absorbed into a law or example test once you understand the underlying rule.

We don’t distinguish “unit/integration/e2e” by ceremony; those are just scopes:

* A “unit test” is a **law or example** test at a small boundary.
* An “integration test” is a **scenario** over more parts of the system.

If you can’t tag a test as Law / Example / Scenario / Regression, change it until you can.

## 2.1 The default suite is the real suite

Some property tests exercise expensive setup (git repos, IPC daemons, large payloads). These are
valuable and must stay covered by the canonical local and CI verification path.

Guidelines:
- `cargo xtest` is the default proof loop for the full workspace surface.
- Heavy tests may keep feature gates for narrow local iteration, but those gates must be enabled by the canonical suite.
- Do not add a second slow lane. If a test is too slow for the default suite, improve the fixture, clock, data shape, or assertion layer until it fits.

Use exact filters while iterating, then finish with the full suite:

```bash
cargo test -p <crate> --features slow-tests <exact_test> -- --exact
cargo xtest
```

Totally fair. That section *was* a bit hand‑wavy for how central contracts are in your world.

Here’s a beefed‑up **Section 3** you can drop in verbatim over the old one — still mechanical, but with enough shape that people will actually build the right thing.

## 3. Contract tests for traits

From the trait doc: traits are promises made to strangers.  
Contract tests are how we **enforce** those promises across implementations.

Mechanically:

> For every cold trait, we want *one* shared contract suite that every implementation must pass.

If a trait has no contract suite, it’s polymorphism without accountability.

---

### 3.1 Shape of a contract suite

For a cold trait `T`, we define:

1. A **factory** for implementations used in tests:

   ```rust
   pub trait Make<T> {
       fn make(&self) -> T;
   }
   ```

or just `impl Fn() -> T` where that’s enough.

2. A set of **law tests** that take a `&Make<T>` (or `impl Fn() -> T`) and only talk in terms of the trait:

   ```rust
   pub fn storage_laws<S, M>(m: &M)
   where
       S: Storage,           // the trait under test
       M: Make<S>,           // how to get a fresh instance
   {
       get_after_put_round_trips(m);
       put_is_idempotent(m);
       errors_match_spec(m);
   }
   ```

3. Optional **scenario tests** for protocol‑level guarantees that live at the trait boundary:
   concurrency behavior, ordering, time‑related semantics, etc.

Key constraint:

> Contract tests talk only in terms of the trait’s types, methods, and documented error enums.
> They never reach into implementation‑specific fields, DB schemas, or helper methods.

If a test needs to look behind the trait, that behavior doesn’t belong in the trait contract.

---

### 3.2 Example: `Storage`

Suppose we have:

```rust
pub trait Storage {
    type Key;
    type Value;
    type Error;

    fn get(&self, key: &Self::Key) -> Result<Option<Self::Value>, Self::Error>;
    fn put(&self, key: Self::Key, value: Self::Value) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;
}
```

A minimal contract suite might look like:

```rust
pub fn storage_laws<S, M>(m: &M)
where
    S: Storage<Key = String, Value = String, Error = StorageError>,
    M: Make<S>,
{
    get_after_put_returns_value(m);
    put_overwrites_previous_value(m);
    get_on_missing_key_is_none(m);
    put_is_idempotent_for_same_value(m);
    invalid_key_surfaces_as_invalid_key_error(m);
}
```

Each helper:

* gets a **fresh** `S` from the factory,
* exercises the trait only through `get`/`put`,
* asserts on:

  * returned values,
  * `StorageError` variants and classification helpers,
  * documented side effects (e.g. overwrites vs merges).

When you add a new backend (`InMemoryStorage`, `PostgresStorage`, `RemoteStorage`), you just:

```rust
#[test]
fn postgres_storage_satisfies_storage_laws() {
    let maker = PostgresStorageMaker::new(test_db_url());
    storage_laws::<PostgresStorage, _>(&maker);
}
```

If it can’t pass, there are only two possibilities:

1. The implementation is wrong; or
2. The trait’s promise doesn’t match reality and needs to change (split trait, adjust errors, etc.).

Both are useful outcomes.

---

### 3.3 Which traits get contracts?

We only bother with full contract suites for **cold traits**:

* used across modules/crates,
* expected to have multiple implementations *or* to survive for a long time,
* whose misuse would be expensive (storage, evaluation, auth, payments…).

Hot traits (experiments, local abstractions) can live with local tests.
Once a trait goes cold, the contract suite is required.

---

### 3.4 Rules of thumb

When designing/using contract tests:

* **One suite per trait**, not per implementation.
  The suite lives next to the trait definition, not next to the backends.

* **Single source of truth for laws.**
  The laws written in the trait docs and the laws encoded in the contract tests should be the same set of statements.

* **Cold by default.**
  Contract tests are cold: changing them means changing the trait’s spec. That should be rare and deliberate.

* **No “implementation‑only” tests that duplicate the contract.**
  Implementation‑specific tests should focus on things *beyond* the shared contract
  (e.g. performance guarantees, migration behavior), not re‑assert the same laws.

Traits without contract tests are polymorphism without accountability.
Implementations that don’t run the contract suite are untrusted.

---

## 4. Hot vs cold tests

We reuse the temperature idea:

* **Cold tests**

  * Encode behavior you’re committing to long‑term: trait laws, protocol contracts, public HTTP semantics.
  * These should rarely change. Breaking them is a spec change, not a refactor.

* **Hot tests**

  * Surround experimental code, unstable APIs, in‑progress refactors.
  * They’re allowed to be looser and more example‑oriented.
  * They should either mature into cold tests or be deleted.

Rules:

* Don’t pin hot behavior with cold tests.
* Don’t run hot tests in the same gates / pipelines as cold ones without labeling; otherwise everything feels equally sacred.

---

## 5. Smells (short list)

Things that should trigger an immediate “why does this exist?” reaction:

1. **Coverage‑driven noise**

   * Tests whose only purpose is bumping coverage.
   * Names don’t describe a claim; assertions are tautologies (“it returns something”).
   * Ask: *which family of wrong implementations does this kill?* If you can’t answer, delete.

2. **Interaction fetish**

   * Tests asserting “method X called method Y once” via mocks.
   * The behavior you actually care about is at the boundary (what got returned / written / emitted).
   * Fix: assert on observable outcomes, not call graphs, unless the call pattern *is* the spec.

3. **Assertion on non‑spec details**

   * Tests that fail because of:

     * log message wording,
     * JSON field order,
     * internal error strings,
     * implementation details you never promised.
   * Fix: assert on semantic things:

     * error *variants* or classes,
     * HTTP status + structured payload,
     * DB state / side effects.

4. **Facts only asserted at the top**

   * Big E2E tests checking business rules that could be checked on a small pure function or trait.
   * When they fail, you have no idea where the bug is.
   * Fix: move the rule down to the smallest layer that can express it; keep only a thin smoke test up top.

---

## 6. Tiny checklist

When you write or review a test, you should be able to answer these quickly:

1. **What’s the claim?**
   One sentence, in domain language.

2. **What’s the shape?**
   Law / Example / Scenario / Regression — exactly one.

3. **What’s the search space?**
   Single example, a few edge cases, generator, recorded trace?

4. **What’s the oracle?**
   What exactly are we asserting, and is it about *semantics* or *incidental details*?

5. **Which family of wrong implementations does this kill?**
   Name at least one real, plausible “bad implementation” that this test would catch and that other tests wouldn’t.

6. **Is this the lowest level we can assert this fact?**
   If not, move it down.

7. **Is this hot or cold?**
   Are we willing to treat this as “spec” or is it scaffolding around moving targets?

If you can’t answer these, you’re not designing tests yet — you’re just writing code that happens to live in `tests/`.

---

## 7. What tests are *for* in this codebase

Given the rest of our design philosophy:

* Types constrain what states can exist.
* Traits constrain what we can do with those states.
* Errors constrain how failure is expressed.

**Tests constrain which implementations of all that are allowed to ship.**

Practically, that means:

* We write **law suites** for cold traits and core types.
* We add a small number of **example** tests to pin weird domain behavior.
* We use **scenario** tests to enforce contracts at HTTP / job / integration boundaries.
* We add **regression** tests only when a real incident proved we were wrong about something.

And every time we add a test, we ask the same question:

> “Which bad program am I ruling out by doing this?”

If the answer is “none that I care about,” the correct move is to not write the test.

## Boundary
This subtree holds superpowers workflow artifacts: design specs and executable plans.
NEVER: treat this subtree as the canonical home for durable repo policy.

## Routing
- `docs/superpowers/specs/` captures design intent, goals, non-goals, and chosen direction.
- `docs/superpowers/plans/` captures agent-facing execution breakdowns for approved work.
- Maintained repo docs still live elsewhere under `docs/` or the owning subtree.

## Local rules
- Keep files here dated; these are point-in-time workflow artifacts.
- When a spec and plan exist for the same topic, the spec explains why and the plan explains how. Neither proves the work is current or finished.
- If execution changes enduring behavior, update the maintained docs outside this subtree; do not leave new truth trapped only in a superpowers artifact.

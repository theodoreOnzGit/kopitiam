//! The window tree: `:sp`/`:vs` splits, laid out as a binary tree of
//! [`Rect`]s.
//!
//! # Why a tree, and why now, when only one window exists
//!
//! vim's window layout is not a flat list — `:vs` inside an already-split
//! window nests, producing an actual tree (a horizontal split containing a
//! vertical split containing two windows, say). Modelling it as a `Vec` of
//! windows with hand-tracked rectangles works for the first split and then
//! actively fights every split after that. Getting the recursive structure
//! right *before* the multi-window UI is built means adding the second and
//! third split later touches nothing but [`WindowTree::split`] call sites,
//! not the layout algorithm.
//!
//! # `SplitKind` naming
//!
//! Named after the vim command it implements, not after the divider's own
//! orientation, because that's the pairing people actually hold in their
//! head (":split, so the windows stack"). `:split` draws a **horizontal**
//! divider line but stacks windows top-to-bottom; `:vsplit` draws a
//! **vertical** divider and places them side by side. See [`SplitKind`]'s
//! doc comment for the full mapping.
//!
//! # Splits reserve a divider cell
//!
//! Every split reserves exactly one cell — a column for `:vs`, a row for
//! `:sp` — between its two children for the visible [`Separator`] line
//! (Neovim's `WinSeparator`). [`WindowTree::layout`] therefore returns the
//! *reduced* window rectangles (the ones text is actually painted into), and
//! [`WindowTree::separators`] returns where the divider glyphs go. Reserving
//! the cell in the layout, rather than overpainting a border on top of the
//! first column of a pane, is what keeps a border from silently eating a
//! column of buffer text.
